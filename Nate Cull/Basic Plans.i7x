"A library of basic relations, actions and plans for Planner."

Include Planner by Nate Cull.

Volume - Relations

[Being-in is a complex relation. It can mean: the planning actor being in a room (triggering door opening, 
pathfinding and travelling), another NPC being in a room (currently no plans for that), or an object being
located in a room or container (triggering containment, dropping, putting in).]

Being-in is a planning-relation.

[Testing is simple, just use the I7 'is in' relation.]

Planning-testing when the desired relation is being-in (this is the basic testing being in rule):
	if the desired param1 is in the desired param2, rule succeeds;
	rule fails;

[Using I7's 'best route' for now. For more complex pathfinding through lockable doorways, we will need to do things 
more manually.]

Planning when the desired relation is being-in and the desired param1 is the planning actor and the desired param2 is a room (this is the basic travel with best route rule):
	plan 1;
	let here be the location of the planning actor;
	let the way be the best route from here to the desired param2;
	let the next room be the room the way from here;
	if the next room is a room, suggest doing-going with the way;
	rule succeeds;


[To get an ordinary portable object into a room, carry it, take it there, and drop it.]

Planning when the desired relation is being-in and the desired param1 is a portable thing and the desired param1 is not a person and the desired param2 is a room (this is the basic dropping objects in rooms rule):
	plan 1;
	suggest being-carried-by with the desired param1 and the planning actor;
	suggest being-in with the planning actor and the desired param2;
	suggest doing-dropping with the desired param1;
	rule succeeds;


[To get an object inside another object, carry it, open the container, get near the container, and put it in.]

Planning when the desired relation is being-in and the desired param1 is a portable thing and the desired param2 is a container (this is the basic putting things in containers rule):
	plan 1;
	suggest being-carried-by with the desired param1 and the planning actor;
	suggest being-open with the desired param2;
	suggest being-touchable-by with the desired param2 and the planning actor;
	suggest doing-putting-in with the desired param1 and the desired param2;	
	rule succeeds;
	

[Openness - fairly easy. Requires unlocking and touching.]

Being-open is a planning-relation.

Planning-testing when the desired relation is being-open (this is the basic testing being open rule):
	if the desired param1 is open, rule succeeds;
	rule fails;

Planning when the desired relation is being-open and the desired param1 is openable (this is the basic opening rule):
	plan 1;
	suggest being-unlocked with the desired param1;
	suggest being-touchable-by with the desired param1 and the planning actor;
	suggest doing-opening with the desired param1;
	rule succeeds;


[Closedness - the reverse of openness.]

Being-closed is a planning-relation.

Planning-testing when the desired relation is being-closed (this is the basic testing being closed rule):
	if the desired param1 is closed, rule succeeds;
	rule fails;

Planning when the desired relation is being-closed and the desired param1 is openable (this is the basic closing rule):
	plan 1;
	suggest being-unlocked with the desired param1;
	suggest being-touchable-by with the desired param1 and the planning actor;
	suggest doing-closing with the desired param1;
	rule succeeds;

[Lockedness - much the same deal. Assumes that if it's a lockable thing that it uses the I7 'matching key' mechanism.
This will need to be overridden for non-keyed locks.]

Being-locked is a planning-relation.

Planning-testing when the desired relation is being-locked (this is the basic testing being locked rule):
	if the desired param1 is not lockable, rule fails;
	if the desired param1 is locked, rule succeeds;
	rule fails;

Planning when the desired relation is being-locked and the desired param1 is lockable (this is the basic locking rule):
	plan 1;
	suggest being-carried-by with the matching key of the desired param1 and the planning actor;
	suggest being-touchable-by with the desired param1 and the planning actor;
	suggest doing-locking-with with the desired param1 and the matching key of the desired param1;
	rule succeeds;


[Unlockedness. Same deal as locking, in reverse.]

Being-unlocked is a planning-relation.

Planning-testing when the desired relation is being-unlocked (this is the basic being unlocked rule):
	if the desired param1 is not lockable, rule succeeds;
	if the desired param1 is unlocked, rule succeeds;
	rule fails;


Planning when the desired relation is being-unlocked and the desired param1 is lockable (this is the basic unlocking rule):
	plan 1;
	suggest being-carried-by with the matching key of the desired param1 and the planning actor;
	suggest being-touchable-by with the desired param1 and the planning actor;
	suggest doing-unlocking-with with the desired param1 and the matching key of the desired param1;
	rule succeeds;


[Visibility - just reverts to the touchability rules.]

Being-visible-by is a planning-relation.

Planning-testing when the desired relation is being-visible-by (this is the basic being visible rule):
	if the desired param2 can see the desired param1, rule succeeds;
	rule fails;

Planning when the desired relation is being-visible-by (this is the basic finding visibility rule):
	plan 1;
	suggest being-touchable-by with the desired param1 and the desired param2;
	rule succeeds;

[Touchability - this is a bit tricky, as it is the main requirement to manipulate most objects, so it triggers
all our mechanisms of finding and picking up things.]

Being-touchable-by is a planning-relation.

[Use I7 touchability, except we don't consider it 'touchable' if it's being carried by any actor other us.]

Planning-testing when the desired relation is being-touchable-by (this is the basic being touchable rule):
	if the desired param2 cannot touch the desired param1, rule fails;
	if the desired param2 encloses the desired param1, rule succeeds;
	if a person encloses the desired param1, rule fails;
	rule succeeds;

[If it's loose in a room, go to it.]

Planning when the desired relation is being-touchable-by and the holder of the desired param1 is a room (this is the basic touching loose objects rule) :
	plan 1;
	suggest being-in with the desired param2 and the holder of the desired param1;
	rule succeeds;

[For containers and supporters, find the outermost one. Make sure containers are open. In case the triggering 
mechanism of a container is elsewhere or requires finding a key, require it open before finding it - the standard 
openability plans will require touchability anyway.]

Planning when the desired relation is being-touchable-by and the holder of the desired param1 is a container (this is the basic touching contained objects rule):
	plan 1;
	suggest being-open with the holder of the desired param1;
	suggest being-touchable-by with the holder of the desired param1 and the desired param2;
	rule succeeds;

Planning when the desired relation is being-touchable-by and the desired param1 is a thing and the holder of the desired param1 is a supporter (this is the basic touching supported objects rule):
	plan 1;
	suggest being-touchable-by with the holder of the desired param1 and the desired param2;
	rule succeeds;

[There's always two sides to a door, so we have to run two parallel plans. Whichever side is reachable and closest 
will be the one we go to.]

Planning when the desired relation is being-touchable-by and the desired param1 is a door (this is the basic touching doors rule):
	plan 1;
	suggest being-in with the desired param2 and the front side of the desired param1;
	plan 2;
	suggest being-in with the desired param2 and the back side of the desired param1;
	rule succeeds;


[The simple form of 'carried' assumes that we want to be directly holding an object. Dealing with sack-type objects
may be a little more complicated. Otherwise, just be near it and pick it up.]

Being-carried-by is a planning-relation.

Planning-testing when the desired relation is being-carried-by (this is the basic being carried rule):
	if the desired param2 carries the desired param1, rule succeeds;
	rule fails;

Planning when the desired relation is being-carried-by and the desired param1 is portable and the desired param2 is the planning actor (this is the basic carrying rule):
	plan 1;
	suggest being-touchable-by with the desired param1 and the planning actor;
	suggest doing-taking with the desired param1;
	rule succeeds;

[Wearing is pretty simple - carry it, then wear it.]

Being-worn-by is a planning-relation.

Planning-testing when the desired relation is being-worn-by (this is the basic being worn rule):
	if the desired param2 wears the desired param1, rule succeeds;
	rule fails;

Planning when the desired relation is being-worn-by and the desired param2 is the planning actor (this is the basic wearability rule):
	plan 1;
	suggest being-carried-by with the desired param1 and the planning actor;
	suggest doing-wearing with the desired param1;
	rule succeeds;

[There's probably an interesting case where we might want to carry but not wear an object, but for now we'll assume
that we just want something not worn, leaving it carried or not carried depending on how we started.]

Being-not-worn-by is a planning-relation.

Planning-testing when the desired relation is being-not-worn-by:
	if the desired param1 is worn by the desired param2, rule fails;
	rule succeeds;

Planning when the desired relation is being-not-worn-by and the desired param2 is the planning actor:
	plan 1;
	suggest doing-taking-off with the desired param1;


Volume 2 - Actions

[The actions are all pretty much just wrappers around the I7 actions. Configuration of custom messages and results
for actors doing things should go as rules on the actions.]


Doing-going is a planning-action.

Planning-acting when the planned action is doing-going (this is the basic executing going rule):
	try the planning actor trying going the planned param1;


Doing-opening is a planning-action.

Basic Plans ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

This is a set of basic plans to go along with Planner.

Text of a demo game follows.


Example: ** Alchemy - A demo game showing use of these basic actions.

	*: "Alchemy" by Nate Cull

	[This is a demo game for Planner.]

	The release number is 2.
	The story creation year is 2006.
	The story headline is "An Interactive Demonstration"

	Include Basic Plans by Nate Cull.

	The Laboratory is a room. The description of the Laboratory is "A chaos of glassware, dark sigils, spellcasting apparatus sprawled in disgusting confusion -- in other words, a perfectly normal research lab. A stone archway leads east and another south."

	The Library is east of the Laboratory. The description of the Library is "The stony walls are racked with square miles of parchment volumes." 

	A curiously carved table is a supporter in the Library.

	A rosewood bench is a supporter in the laboratory. "A rosewood bench, scarred and burned by years of incantations, fills half of the room."

	An iron crucible is an open container on the rosewood bench. "Bob's crucible bubbles merrily on the bench."

	A cupboard is a closed openable container in the laboratory. "A cupboard of great antiquity quietly blends into the corner shadows."

	A plastic bag is a closed transparent portable openable container on the carved table.

	A Chinese puzzle box is a locked lockable closed openable portable container in the plastic bag.

	A pinch of ginger is a portable thing in the puzzle box.

	A wicker basket is an open container in the cupboard.

	An onion, a tomato, a stick of celery, a lemon and a banana are in the wicker basket.

	Broth is a thing.

	The basic putting things in containers rule does nothing when the desired relation is being-in and the desired param1 is broth and the desired param2 is the crucible.

	Planning when the desired relation is being-in and the desired param1 is broth and the desired param2 is the crucible:
		plan 1;
		suggest being-in with the onion and the crucible;
		suggest being-in with the celery and the crucible;
		suggest being-in with the banana and the crucible;
		suggest being-in with the ginger and the crucible;

	To decide whether soup is brewing:
		if the onion is not in the crucible, decide no;
		if the celery is not in the crucible, decide no;
		if the banana is not in the crucible, decide no;
		if the ginger is not in the crucible, decide no;
		decide yes;


	Every turn when soup is brewing:
		if the crucible is visible, say "The crucible simmers; the contents meld into a rich pungent vegetable broth.";
		repeat with item running through things in the crucible begin;
			now item is nowhere;
		end repeat;
	now broth is in the crucible;

	The Alcove is a room.

	The Alcove is south of the Laboratory. The description of the Alcove is "A tiny niche carved out of the stone, which opens out to the north."

	A brass hook is a supporter in the Alcove. "Screwed into the stonework with grim determination is a shiny brass hook." The brass hook has carrying capacity 1.

	A silver key is on the brass hook. The matching key of the Chinese puzzle box is the silver key.



	Bob is a person in the laboratory. "The mighty wizard Bob potters around his domain."

	The description of Bob is "Bob is carrying [if bob carries anything][list of things carried by bob][otherwise]nothing[end if]."

	The basic dropping objects in rooms rule does nothing when the desired relation is being-in and the desired param1 is a person.

	Every turn:
		have Bob plan an action for being-in with broth and the crucible;

	Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of Bob:
		decide no;



	Section - Custom Actions

	[Asking a person for an object is an alternative plan for getting hold of an object. It's the sort of strategy that would only be appropriate in some genres, so it's not in Basic Plans.]

	Doing-asking-for is a planning-action.

	Planning-acting when the planned action is doing-asking-for:
		try the planning actor trying asking the planned param1 for the planned param2;

	Planning rule when the desired relation is being-touchable-by and the desired param2 is the planning actor and a person (called the owner) encloses the desired param1:
		plan 1;
		suggest being-touchable-by with the owner and the planning actor;
		suggest doing-asking-for with the owner and the desired param1;


	The block giving rule does nothing when the second noun is Bob.


	Section - Custom Messages

	[The 'action success flag' trick we use is a bit of a nasty hack. There is probably a better way to find out if an action succeeds, but I don't know it yet. For the moment we use this, but it only gets set if an 'after' rule runs, which means if we use 'instead' to block the action, we need to set it manually. We should probably have a phrase for this, but it's so ugly there's likely to be a more permanent solution anyway.]

	Instead of Bob trying asking the player for something:
		say "'I say, old chap,' mutters Bob. 'Do be a sport and give me [the second noun].'";	
		now the action success flag is 1;

	Planning-failure:
		say "Bob scratches his beard and looks perplexed.";

	Planning-success:
		end the story finally saying "You have witnessed the Making of Soup";	

	Planning-acting-failure:
		say "'Arr, that didn't work,' says Bob. 'Reality be getting a mite thin.'";

	Report Bob trying opening the cupboard for the first time:
		say "'Aslan sesameslan!' says Bob, flinging the cupboard doors wide open to reveal [list of things in the cupboard].";
		stop the action;

	[Another nasty hack just to get a nice message when Bob takes something from a container rather than from the room. Must be a better way to do this.]

	The previous take holder is an object that varies.

	Before Bob trying taking something:
		now the previous take holder is the holder of the noun;

	Report Bob trying taking something:
		if the previous take holder is not a room begin;
			say "Bob takes [the noun] from [the previous take holder].";
			stop the action;
		end if;
