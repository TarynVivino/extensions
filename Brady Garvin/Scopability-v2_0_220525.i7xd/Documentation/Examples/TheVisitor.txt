Example: * The Visitor
Description: An object that is present but unrevealed.

	{*}"The Visitor"

	Include Scopability by Brady Garvin.

	Cavern is a room.
	The rocky debris is scenery.
	The alien artifact is an unscopable thing in the cavern.
	"It's embedded in the rock!"
	The description of the alien artifact is "It looks alien."

	Every turn when the alien artifact is in the location:
		say "There's a faint humming coming from above."

	Instead of listening when the alien artifact is in the location:
		say "Hmmmm hmmmm hmmmm.  Hm hm hm hm.  Hmmmm hm hm.  Hm.  Hm hmmmm.  Hm hmmmm hm."

	Instead of jumping when the alien artifact is in the location and the alien artifact is not scopable:
		say "The jolt shakes [rocky debris] loose from the ceiling, revealing [an alien artifact]!";
		now the rocky debris is in the location;
		now the alien artifact is scopable;
		now the alien artifact is not scenery.

	Test me with "z / listen / x artifact / jump / x artifact".
