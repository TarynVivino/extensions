Example: * Meeting Place
Description: using arbitrary binary relations

Use the full power of arbitrary binary relations, which are poorly documented in the Inform 7 manual.  Show how to specify an action applying to a thing in the room and a thing not in the room.

	{*}"Meeting Place"

	Meeting Place is a room.

	A government is a kind of thing.

	[In an earlier version, I used "US" here, but Inform 10.1.0 misinterprets that as the word "us".  So it's "USA".]

	USA, UK, France, Germany, Russia, China, India, Pakistan are governments.

	Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon are people in Meeting Place.

	Trusting relates various people to various governments.
	The verb to trust means the trusting relation.

	Alpha trusts USA.  Alpha trusts UK.
	Beta trusts USA.  Beta trusts France.
	Gamma trusts China.  Gamma trusts France.

	Understand "ask [someone] about [any government]" as asking it opinion about.
	Asking it opinion about is an action applying to one thing and one visible thing.
	[Note the completely misleading and perverse use of "visible thing" to mean "thing not necessary touchable".]

	Report asking a person (called who) opinion about a government (called what):
		if who trusts what:
			say "[Who] [say] 'Great country, I'd love to live there.'";
		else:
			say "[Who] [say] 'Nice people there, but I wouldn't want to live under their government.'";
