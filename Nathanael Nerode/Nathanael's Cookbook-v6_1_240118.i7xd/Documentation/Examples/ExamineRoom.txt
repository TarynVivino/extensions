Example: * Examine Room
Description: putting the room in scope

If you're in a room called "Main Street", you probably want "look at main street" to work.  By default, it doesn't.

	{*}"Examine Room"

	Main Street is a room.
	"This is the center of the city, where it all happens!"

	After deciding the scope of an object (called character) (this is the put room in scope rule):
		Place the location of the character in scope, but not its contents.

	Rule for deciding whether all includes rooms:
		it does not.

	test me with "examine street/examine main street/take all".
