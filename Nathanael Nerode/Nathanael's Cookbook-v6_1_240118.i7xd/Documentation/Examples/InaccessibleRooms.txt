Example: * Inaccessible rooms

This provides a substantially cleaner way to model outdoor rooms than "Instead of going north...".  There is less repeated coding.

	{*}"Inaccessible rooms"

	An outside room is a kind of room.
	An outside room has a list of rooms called views.

	["look north"]
	Check examining a direction (called direction D) when the location is an outside room:
		let the target be the room-or-door direction D from the location;
		if the target is listed in the views of the location:
			try examining the target instead;
		if the target is a door in the location:
			try examining the target instead;
		[ otherwise pass back to standard rules]
		make no decision.

	[This allows the player to refer to rooms by name.]
	After deciding the scope of an object (called character):
		let loc be the location of the character;
		Place the loc in scope, but not its contents;
		if loc is an outside room:
			repeat with view running through the views of location:
				Place view in scope;

	An inaccessible room is a kind of room.
	An inaccessible room has a text called the no go text.
	The no go text of an inaccessible room is usually "[the description of the item described]".
	[This actually implements the you-can't-go-that-way response.]
	Instead of going to an inaccessible room (called target):
		say "[the no go text of the target][line break]".

	Carry out looking when the location is an inaccessible room:
		say "[italic type]You have found a bug in the game.  You should not be able to be in this location.  Please report this bug with a transcript to the author.[roman type][line break]".

	Empty field is an outside room.
	"This is an empty field, surrounded by the vast, inhospitable wilderness."

	Vast wilderness is an inaccessible room.
	"The wilderness is vast, and inhospitable."
	Understand "inhospitable" as the vast wilderness.
	The no go text of the vast wilderness is "You quake at the thought of being lost in the vast wilderness, and decide not to go that way."

	The views of the empty field are {vast wilderness}.
	North of empty field is vast wilderness.
	South of empty field is vast wilderness.
	East of empty field is vast wilderness.
	West of empty field is vast wilderness.
	Northeast of empty field is vast wilderness.
	Northwest of empty field is vast wilderness.
	Southeast of empty field is vast wilderness.
	Southwest of empty field is vast wilderness.
