Example: * Careful Startup
Description: displaying messages at the right time during startup

	{*}"Careful Startup"

	Bedroom is a room.

	The description of Bedroom is "There's a double bed here."

	A bed is a kind of supporter.
	The latticework double bed is a bed in the bedroom.
	The description of the latticework double bed is "It's a double bed with a latticework headboard."
	
	The player is on the latticework double bed.  [This is the correct way to set a starting location.]

	This is the teaser rule:
		say "Nightmares.  Fear.  Running."

	The teaser rule is listed before the display banner rule in the startup rulebook.

	This is the introduce the game rule:
		say "You blearily open your eyes, shaking away dreams.  You're in your bed."

	The introduce the game rule is listed before the initial room description rule in the startup rulebook.
	[Note: "After the display banner rule" won't work, it'll end up after the initial room description.]

	This is the just before the prompt rule:
		say "Maybe you should get up.[line break][paragraph break]";
		[ Note: [paragraph break][line break] will give TWO blank lines after this.
			[paragraph break] alone, [line break] alone, or neither will give NO blank lines.
			This is the way to give the standard ONE blank line before the prompt.
		]

	The just before the prompt rule is listed after the initial room description rule in the startup rulebook.

	[ This is the default order of the startup rulebook:
	First come the very basic rules:
		initalize memory rule
		seed random number generator rule
		update chronological records rule
		declare everything initially unmentioned rule
		position player in model world rule
		start in the correct scenes rule
	Then come the so-called "mid-placed rules":
		when play begins stage rule
		fix baseline scoring rule
		display banner rule
		initial room description rule
