Example: ** Purgatory II
Description: As an additional enhancement, we make an automatic undo attempt after the player has died.

	{*}"Purgatory II"

	Include Undo Output Control by Nathanael Nerode.
	
	The story author is "Erik Temple".
	The release number is 3.
	
	Black Room is a room. There is a bottle of poison in Black Room.
	
	Instead of drinking the bottle of poison:
		now the printed name of the bottle is "empty bottle";
		say "You drink down the poison in a single draught! That probably wasn't very smart.";
		disable saving of undo state.
	
	Every turn when the printed name of the bottle is "empty bottle":
		say "[one of]Your cheeks burn.[or]Your teeth hurt.[or]Your belly twists.[or]Your vision fades.[the end][stopping]"
	
	To say the end:
		say "You have died.";
		say "[bracket]...maybe you shouldn't have drunk the poison.  Attempting to undo to the moment just before you drank the poison.[close bracket][paragraph break]";
		undo the current turn;
		say "[bracket] Well, I guess that didn't work. [close bracket][paragraph break]";
		end the story saying "You have died".
	
	Before undoing an action when save undo state is false:
		say "[bracket]Attempting to undo to the moment just before you drank the poison.[close bracket][paragraph break]";
		rule succeeds.
	
	Report undoing an action:
		say "[bold type]";
		say "[Location]" in title case;
		say "[roman type]";
		say "[line break]";
		say "[bracket]Undone.[close bracket][line break]";
		enable saving of undo state;
		rule succeeds.
		
	Check saving the game when save undo state is false:
		say "Maybe it would be best to UNDO your terrible mistake before saving. Are you sure you want to save now, while you're dying? ";
		if the player consents:
			continue the action;
		otherwise:
			rule fails.

	test me with "look / drink poison / look / look / look"
