If you're writing an adventure game, you won't want this.  This is for games with very different themes, specifically social themes.

This extension removes a lot of the verb synonyms from the standard rules, so that (for example) "dust object" is no longer a synonym for "rub object".  This is to avoid misleading reactions.

It also removes most of the verb words which just have minimal stub implementations (like jump, cut, and attach).

It removes the unimplemented kiss and embrace and hug, which in a social game should probably not be synonyms.
Likewise it removes attack and all its synonyms.

It also removes "push", which actually is implemented for shoving objects from room to room.  This is probably not the most intuitive meaning of "push" in a socially oriented game.

The selection of which verbs to leave was somewhat arbitrary, based on the game I was working on at the time.
