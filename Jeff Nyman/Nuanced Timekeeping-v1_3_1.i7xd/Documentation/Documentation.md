This extension provides a slightly more realistic accounting of time by allowing the time value to include seconds.

If you want the more nuanced, or more realistic, you simply have to apply the rule from this extension as so:

	The realistic time rule is listed instead of the advance time rule in the turn sequence rules.

If you want the time to be reflected you can use a phrase as such:

	say "Your watch says it's [realistic time]."
