This extension allows for contextually shifting descriptions for rooms. What that means is simply that how a room is described in some particulars may differ based on what the protagonist has seen. The underlying idea here is that how we "describe" a location to others or even to ourselves would differ if this is the first time we're seeing the location versus seeing it again at a different time.

To this end, the extension provides a "visited summary" and "unvisited summary" to be applied to rooms. These are what can be displayed after the initial impressions (description) has been shown.

It's quite possible, of course, for someone to re-think about their first impressions or, in the context of a story, the player may want to recover that full description. The "impressions" action allows the player to recover that initial description. It's necessary to provide an action like this because a generic "look" might not do it if the room description uses constructs like "[if unvisisted]".
