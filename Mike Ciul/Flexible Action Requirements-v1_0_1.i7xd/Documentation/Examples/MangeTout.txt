	Include Flexible Action Requirements by Mike Ciul.

	Wimbledon Stadium is a room. A giant blancmange is a fixed in place edible thing in Wimbledon Stadium.

	The fans are a plural-named person in Wimbledon.

	Accessibility rule when the fans must be touched:
		say "The fans are too far away.";
		stop the action;

	Instead of listening to the fans when the blancmange is off-stage:
		say "A tremendous roar of jubilation washes over you.";
		end the story finally saying "You have won the match."
	
	Instead of listening to the fans:
		say "The crowd is hushed with terror and anticipation.";
	
	Eating is flexible about carrying the noun.
	Listening is flexible about touching the noun.
