Example: * The Den
Description: just describing some things

This example just sets up some random objects, and there's a "when play begins" rule that iterates over all the things and list the properties. This is just to give you and idea of how this works.
It also illustrates how to add a new rule for a specific kind.

*: "The Den"

	Include Object Descriptors by Peter Orme.

	The Den is a room.

	The wooden chest is a container in the den. It is closed, openable.

	Mrs Benson is a woman in the den.

	the marble bench is a supporter in the den. It is fixed in place.

	the portal is a door. It is outside from the den.

	the rat king is an animal in the den. The indefinite article is "a". it is plural-named.

	The laser slicer is a switched off, unlit device in the den.

	after switching on the laser slicer:
		now the laser slicer is lit;
		continue the action.

	after switching off the laser slicer:
		now the laser slicer is unlit;
		continue the action.

	[Let's also introduce a new Kind of Thing. Custom properties won't break anything, but they won't be described unless we add an object descriptor rule for it]

	a wooz is a kind of thing. a wooz can be floppy or stiff.

	an Object Descriptor rule for a wooz (called item):
		if the item is floppy, add "floppy" to the descriptor list;
		if the item is stiff, add "stiff" to the descriptor list;

	There is a floppy edible wooz called a spongy cake in the lab.

	when play begins:
		repeat with item running through things:
			say "[item] - [the object descriptors of the item].";
