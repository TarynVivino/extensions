Object Descriptors adds the ability to list properties of objects, a bit like the "showme" command does, but this makes it available from
other code (for example, for inclusion in debug logs).

We can add rules to customize which properties are listed when we're inspecting a specific object kind.

The extension comes with rules already set up for many of the built-in kinds such as containers and people, but it is easy to add additional rules for other kinds.
