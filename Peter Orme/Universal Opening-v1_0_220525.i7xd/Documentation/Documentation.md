This extension provides you with testing commands for force opening things. The commands are all in sections marked as "not for release" - this is intended to be a tool during development and test, not for actual games.

Section: Testing commands available to the player

The extension provides you with a "openall" command, available in several versions.

First of all you can open one single thing.  If you have a safe and you want it open, just go "openall safe". This works both on doors and containers - anything that is "openable". Note that it does not unlock things, but rather just opens them, ignoring any locked property.

Second, you can open lots of things at once. "openalldoors", in one word, will open all doors. All of them at once, that is.

Third, you can do that to all things except doors. The command is "openallthings".

Fourth, you can open everything - all doors, and all things. The command is "openall".

Changelog:
	1.0.220524: Update for v10.1.  Main issue was need to have short action names.  Also allow openall to be used on things not in scope. (Nathanael Nerode)
	1/120223: First version.
