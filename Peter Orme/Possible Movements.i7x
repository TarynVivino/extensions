		let L be the list of enterable things in the location of the player;
		if L is not empty:
			say "You could try entering [L with definite articles]. ";
		[otherwise:
			say "There is nothing obvious you can enter. ";]
				
To say exit list: 
	say "Obvious exits from [the location]: [line break]";
	repeat with way running through directions:

		if place is a visited room:

		otherwise if place is a room:
			say "[way][line break]";

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

This provides two commands available to the player: "exits" which lists all the obvious exits in the current location, and "enterables" which lists the enterable things.
