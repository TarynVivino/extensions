Example: * Asserting Arithmetic
Description: Using assertions to check we know how to do math operations.

In this example we make an "assert" verb available to the player. Another option is just calling the asserts in a "when play begins" method. We don't really need an extension like this to test the standard built-in arithmetic of Inform7, but this illustrates the idea.

	{*}"Asserting Arithmetic"

	the demo is a room.

	include Unit Testing by Peter Orme.

	to perform asserts:
		assert 3 + 3 is 6 saying "adding numbers";
		assert 3 - 1 is 2 saying "subtracting numbers";
		assert 1 * 4 is 4 saying "mutliplying numbers";
		assert that 2 + 2 is 4;
		assert 5 - 2 is 3;

	asserting is an action out of world applying to nothing. Understand "assert" as asserting.

	carry out asserting:
		now the verbosity of the asserter is normal verbosity;
		perform asserts;
		report asserts using high verbosity.
		
	test me with "assert";
