This extension lets your record highscores to an external file. There is one basic phrase:

	record score of (score - a number) and review highscores from (ext - external file)

Depending on whether the score is a new highscore or not, there are three say phrases for reporting back the result. You can overwrite these in your game as you wish.

The "say the game checksum" phrase will also print the game's checksum, which you could display after the game's banner or anywhere else.
