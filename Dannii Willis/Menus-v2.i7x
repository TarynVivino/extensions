Part - Tables

[ Define the column types for Menus. The old column names will still work. ]

Table of Menu column definitions
title	text	description	submenu	subtable	rule	toggle	hidden-row
""	""	""	a table-name	a table-name	a rule	a rule	a truth state

[ These tables define how the status bar is shown in menus ]

left	central	right
""	"[current menu title]"	""

Table of Deep Menu Status
left	central	right
""	"[current menu title]"	""
""	""	""
" Select a number"	""	"Esc/Q = Back "

[ This table stores the history of menus considered. Essentially we push/pop to it. ]

Table of Menu history
title (text)	submenu (table-name)
with 10 blank rows



Part - Menus [Variables]

The current menu is a table-name variable. The current menu is Table of Menu column definitions.
The current menu title is a text variable. The current menu title is "Instructions".

Section - unindexed

Menu header is a table-name variable. The menu header is Table of Deep Menu Status.

Menu depth is a number variable. Menu depth is 0.


Part - Menu labels

[ This Part can be replaced to allow more/different labels to be printed and accepted ]

[ We support 1-9 and A-P by default. This phrase is for your code to check - the extension does not use it. ]
To decide which number is the maximum number of menu labels:
	decide on 25;

Section - unindexed

To say menu character number (x - a number):
	(- print (char) ({x} + 55); -).

To say menu label (x - a number):
	if x < 10:
		say x;
	otherwise:
		say menu character number x;

[ For use with glulx hyperlinks ]
To decide what number is the character number for menu label (x - a number):
	if x is -1:
		decide on 81;
	if x < 10:
		decide on x + 48;
	otherwise:
		decide on x + 55;

[ -1 = Go back, 0 = invalid, 1+ = menu choice (but the menu must be checked to see if the row even exists!) ]
To decide what number is the chosen menu option for (x - a number):
	[ Esc/Q ]
	if x is -8 or x is 27 or x is 81 or x is 113:

Part - Glulx interface effects (for Glulx only)

Chapter - Popover menu window (for use with Flexible Windows by Jon Ingold)

disable the popover menu window is a truth state variable. [ False by default - i.e. the popover window will be used ]

The popover menu window is a text buffer g-window spawned by the main window.
The position of the popover menu window is g-placeabove.
The scale method of the popover menu window is g-proportional.
The measurement of the popover menu window is 100.

First before displaying rule (this is the switch to the popover menu window rule):
	if disable the popover menu window is false:
		open the popover menu window, as the acting main window;

Last after displaying rule (this is the switch back to the main-window rule):

A glulx input handling rule for a hyperlink-event while displaying (this is the intercept menu hyperlinks rule):
	if enable menu hyperlinks is true:
		convert the hyperlink code to the character code;
		cancel character input in the main window;
		request hyperlink input again;
		replace player input;
		
[ gg_arguments-->0 will be used as the character code selected, so set it to the hyperlink code ]
To convert the hyperlink code to the character code:
	(- gg_arguments-->0 = gg_event-->2; -).

To request hyperlink input again:
	(- glk_request_hyperlink_event( gg_event-->1 ); -).

	cancel character input in the main window;



Menus ends here.



---- Documentation ----

Section: Basic Use

"Menus" provides a table-based way to display menus to the player. The menu takes over the main screen of the game and prevents parser input while it is active. 

"Menus" is not suitable for contexts where we want the player to be able to choose a numbered option during regular play (such as a menu of conversation choices when talking to another character). It is intended rather for situations where we wish to give the player optional instructions or hints separated from the main game.

Any given menu option may do one (and only one) of the following three things:

1) display some text to players, after which they can press a key to return to the menu. This tends to be useful for such menu options as "About this Game" and "Credits", where we have a few paragraphs of information that we would like to share.

2) trigger a secondary menu with additional options. The player may navigate this submenu, then return to the main menu. Submenus may be nested.

3) carry out a rule. This might perform any action, including making changes to the game state.

Menus are specified by tables, in which each row contains one of the menu options, together with instructions to Inform about how to behave when that option is selected. 

Each menu table should have columns called "title", "text", "submenu", "rule", and "hidden-row".

"Title" should be the name of the option we want the player to see: "Credits", "Hints", "About This Game", and so on.

"Text" is the text that will be printed when the option is selected. We can fill it in with as much information as we like.

"Submenu" is used to create a submenu; this column holds the name of the table that specifies the menu. For instance:

	Table of Options
	title	text (some text)	submenu (a table-name)	rule (a rule)	hidden-row (a truth state)
	"Settings"	--	Table of Setting Options

would create an option entitled "Settings", which the player could select to view a submenu of setting options. That submenu would in turn need its own table, thus

	Table of Setting Options
	title	text (some text)	submenu (a table-name)	rule (a rule)	hidden-row (a truth state)
	""

If we do not want a given option to trigger a new submenu, we can leave it as "--".

The "rule" column contains the rule carried out when this option is chosen. In theory, this rule could be absolutely anything. In practice, the feature is mostly useful for giving the player a table of setting options which he can toggle on and off: for instance, we might provide the option "use verbose room descriptions", and then have the toggle rule change the game's internal settings about how room descriptions are displayed. (See the example attached for further guidance.)

It is only useful for a given option to have one of these three features -- text or a submenu or a rule. In the event that more than one column is filled out, the game will obey the rule in preference to creating a submenu, and create a submenu in preference to displaying text. 

The "hidden-row" column can be used if we want to hide a given option. To hide the menu option, we mark this column "true". If we want the option visible, we can either leave the column empty, or mark it "false".

To display our menu to the player, we can write

	display the Table of Options menu with title "Instructions"

where "Table of Options" is the name of our table, and "Instructions" is the heading we'd like to appear above the menu.

Section: Optional Glulx Features

This extension offers a few additional features for Glulx projects: a popover window, and menu hyperlinks.

A popover window will temporarily hide (rather than permanently clear) the visible story text when the player opens a menu. When players exit the menu, they will be able to see their previous actions in scrollback.

The popover window feature requires the extension Flexible Windows by Jon Ingold. We will need to include Flexible Windows before Menus in our project. So long as we do this, the popover window will be used by default.

If we've included Flexible Windows but don't want the popover window, we can disable this feature as follows:

	disable the popover menu window is true
	
Menu hyperlinks require the extension Glulx Entry Points by Emily Short, which must be included before Menus.

Menu hyperlinks are disabled by default. We can enable them as follows:

	enable menu hyperlinks is true


Example: * Tabulation - A simple table of hints and help (see also Basic Help Menu).

For instance our Table of Options might look like this:

	*: "Tabulation" by Secretive J.
	
	Include Menus by Dannii Willis. [Change this to Emily Short when the extension is finished.]
	Use scoring.

	Table of Options
	title	text (some text)	submenu (a table-name)	rule (a rule)	hidden-row (a truth state)
	"Introduction to [story title]"	"This is a simple demonstration [story genre] game."
	"Settings"	--	Table of Setting Options
	"About the Author"	"[story author] is too reclusive to wish to disseminate any information. Sorry."
[	"Hints"	--	Table of Hints	Commenting this out for now because it doesn't work]

	Table of Setting Options
	title	text (some text)	submenu (a table-name)	rule (a rule)	hidden-row (a truth state)
	"[if notify mode is on]Score notification on[otherwise]Score notification off[end if]"	--	--	switch notification status rule

	To decide whether notify mode is on:
		(- notify_mode -);

	This is the switch notification status rule:
		if notify mode is on, try switching score notification off;
		otherwise try switching score notification on.

	[After each activation of the toggle rule, the menu redraws itself, so the player will see "score notification on" change to "score notification off" (and vice versa).]

[ Commenting out the hint menu related documentation, because it doesn't work at the moment:

	[Menus also provides for the case where we would like to display hints and give the player the option of revealing more and more detailed instructions. To this end, there is a special form for tables that lead to hints and tables which contain the hints themselves. The table leading to hints should look like this:]

	Table of Hints
	title	text (a text)	submenu (a table-name)	rule (a rule)	hidden-row (a truth state)
	"How do I reach the mastodon's jawbone?"	--	Table of Mastodon Hints		hint toggle rule
	"How can I make Leaky leave me alone?"		--	Table of Leaky Hints	hint toggle rule

	[where the toggle is always "hint toggle rule", and the submenu is always a table containing the hints themselves. A table of hints consists of just two columns, and one of those is for internal bookkeepping and should be initialized to contain a number. So:]

	Table of Mastodon Hints
	hint	used
	"Have you tried Dr. Seaton's Patent Arm-Lengthening Medication?"	a number
	"It's in the pantry."
	"Under some cloths."	

	Table of Leaky Hints
	hint	used
	"Perhaps it would help if you knew something about Leaky's personality."	a number
	"Have you read the phrenology text in the library?"	
	"Have you found Dr. Seaton's plaster phrenology head?"	
	"Now you just need a way to compare this to Leaky's skull."	
	"Too bad he won't sit still."	
	"But he has been wearing a hat. Perhaps you could do something with that."
	"You'll need to get it off his head first."	
	"Have you found the fishing pole?"	
	"And the wire?"	
	"Wait on the balcony until Leaky passes by underneath on his way to the Greenhouse."	
	"FISH FOR THE HAT WITH THE HOOK ON THE WIRE."	
	"Now you'll have to find out what the hat tells you."	
	"Putting it on the phrenology head might allow you to compare."	
	"Of course, if you do that, you'll reshape the felt. Hope you saved a game!"
	"You need a way to preserve the stiffness of the hat."	
	"Have you found the plaster of paris?"	
	"And the water?"	
	"And the kettle?"	

	[...etc. (Hints 19-135 omitted for brevity.)]

	[Because the toggle rule is always consulted when the player selects an option and before any other default behavior occurs, we can use this rule to override normal menu behavior more or less however we like. The hint toggle rule is just one example.]
]
	[Finally, if we wanted to create a HELP command that would summon our menu, we would then add this:]

	Understand "help" or "hint" or "hints" or "about" or "info" as asking for help.

	Asking for help is an action out of world.
	
	Carry out asking for help:
		display the Table of Options menu with title "Instructions".
		
[ Is any of this stuff still necessary?
		now the current menu is the Table of Options; 
		carry out the displaying activity;
		clear the screen;
		try looking.]
		
	The Cranial Capacity Calculation Chamber is a room. Leaky is a man in the Chamber. Leaky wears a pair of overalls and some muddy boots. He is carrying a fishing rod.
[Is this still necessary?
The displaying activity displays whatever is set as the current menu, so we must set the current menu before activating the activity. Afterward it is a good idea to clear the screen before returning to regular play.]
