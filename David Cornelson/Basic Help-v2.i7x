During the game you will encounter puzzles within the story. You may need to open something, talk to someone about something, find something, discover something, and more. Most puzzles should have a logical explanation although sometimes authors get tricky and raise the level of difficulty in a game. In these cases, you should read all of the game text thoroughly, talk to your friends about the game, and eventually you will find a solution. Of course you can always ask for a hint by typing [italic type]hint[roman type]."

Some commands require a single object, as in [italic type]examine painting[roman type]. Other commands have a more complex syntax, such as [italic type]put sock in drawer[roman type]. In some cases, a command will require a preposition and possibly adjectives, as in [italic type]pull the green cart into the south tunnel with the long rope[roman type].

There are several commands that are called 'out of world' commands and these help you interact with the product and not the story. The out of world commands include:[line break][line break]
[bold type]save[roman type] - allows you to save your game[line break]
[bold type]restore[roman type] - allows you to restore a previously saved game[line break]
[bold type]restart[roman type] - allows you to start the game from the beginning[line break]

[bold type]score[roman type] - displays the current score, if the game implements scoring[line break]
[bold type]brief[roman type] - displays short location setting descriptions, but be careful - many games hide their best puzzles in the details of a good description[line break]
[bold type]verbose[roman type] - displays full location setting descriptions (recommended)[line break]"

Chapter 5 - Characters Help

Character Help is a help command.
Understand "character", "characters", "people", "actor", "actors", "npc", "npcs" as Character Help.

Report helping Character Help:
	say "[bold type]Characters Help[roman type]

Every story has a protagonist, the lead, or main character. This is the part that you're playing. But every story also has other characters and Interactive Fiction is no different. Although it's entirely possible to encounter an Interactive Fiction story without any other characters, it's important to understand how to interact with them. Obviously you can use some of the common commands to [italic type]kiss[roman type] or [italic type]kill[roman type] another character, but sometimes it's best to just talk. In order to talk to another character you need to initiate a conversation. Interactive Fiction, just like many books, has different ways of handling conversation.

The most common conversation types include:[line break]
[bold type]menu driven[roman type] - menu driven conversations are a tree-like menu system that allows you to select preset talking points like 'You ask Bob about borrowing the lawn mower.'[line break]
[bold type]ask/tell[roman type] - ask/tell is a simple conversation system that requires you to ask a character about a topic, such as 'ask carol about bob' or 'ask bob about work'[line break]
[bold type]talk to[roman type] - talk to is an even simpler conversation system that requires you to simply talk to a character, as in 'talk to bob' or 'talk to carol' and will often use your current circumstances to identify the appropriate response

The characters within an Interactive Fiction story may help you or they may hinder you. They may provide valuable information or be completely useless. They may follow you or have their own paths to follow. Some will be people, some will be animals, and some might even be a ghost.[line break]";

After a parser error, the hint system will remind the player it's available.

For the first 4 turns in the game, the hint system will show a notice.

The author can add common commands by using the list 'add' feature and this will display them within the 'help commands' description.

	when play begins:
		add "xyzzy" to Help Common Commands.

After the help has stopped reminding the player, the author can set the Help Switch to true and for another 4 turns, the help reminder will be displayed.
