Version 1/210618 of Hidden Prompt by Daniel Stelzer begins here.

"Provides a simple way to hide the command prompt during long stretches of text."

"inspired by Command Prompt On Cue by Ron Newcomb"

[ Fixed typo in title and added version number -- Zed Lopez ]

Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.
Include Command Preloading by Daniel Stelzer.

Section A

Hidden prompt is initially false.
The implicit hidden-prompt command is initially "wait".
The former prompt is initially "".

To say (X - number) as a key: (- print (char) {X}; -).

The hidden-prompt signal is initially "[close bracket] ".

Rule for reading a command when hidden prompt is true (this is the hidden prompt command rule):
	say "[italic type][implicit hidden-prompt command][roman type][line break]";
	change the text of the player's command to the implicit hidden-prompt command.

Section B1 (for use with Command Modification by Daniel Stelzer)

To hide the command prompt:
	if the command override queue is not empty, stop;
	if hidden prompt is true, stop;
	now the former prompt is the command prompt;
	now the command prompt is the hidden-prompt signal;
	now hidden prompt is true.
To hide the command prompt with implicit command (T - text):
	if the command override queue is not empty, stop;
	if hidden prompt is true, stop;
	now the implicit hidden-prompt command is T;
	hide the command prompt.
To show the command prompt:
	if the command override queue is not empty, stop;
	if hidden prompt is false, stop;
	now the command prompt is the former prompt;
	now hidden prompt is false.

Section B2 (for use without Command Modification by Daniel Stelzer)

To hide the command prompt:
	if hidden prompt is true, stop;
	now the former prompt is the command prompt;
	now the command prompt is the hidden-prompt signal;
	now hidden prompt is true.
To hide the command prompt with implicit command (T - text):
	if hidden prompt is true, stop;
	now the implicit hidden-prompt command is T;
	hide the command prompt.
To show the command prompt:
	if hidden prompt is false, stop;
	now the command prompt is the former prompt;
	now hidden prompt is false.

Section C1 (for use with Command Preloading by Daniel Stelzer)

Before reading a command when hidden prompt is true (this is the hidden prompt interruption rule):
	say "[hidden-prompt signal][run paragraph on]";
	let X be the chosen letter;
	unless X is 13 or X is 31 or X is 32 or X is -6 or X is 127:
		preload the command "[X as a key]";
		now the command prompt is the former prompt;
		now hidden prompt is false.

Section C2 (for use without Command Preloading by Daniel Stelzer)

The saved first letter is initially "".

Before reading a command when hidden prompt is true (this is the hidden prompt interruption rule):
	say "[hidden-prompt signal][run paragraph on]";
	let X be the chosen letter;
	unless X is 13 or X is 31 or X is 32 or X is -6 or X is 127:
		now the saved first letter is "[X as a key]";
		now the command prompt is "[former prompt][saved first letter]";
		now hidden prompt is false.

Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is I beg your pardon error and the saved first letter is not empty (this is the hidden prompt single-letter command failure rule):
	now the command prompt is the former prompt;
	now the saved first letter is "".

First after reading a command when hidden prompt is false and the saved first letter is not empty (this is the hidden prompt correct first keystroke rule):
	now the command prompt is the former prompt;
	change the text of the player's command to "[saved first letter][player's command]";
	[say "(changed to [player's command])[command clarification break]";]
	now the saved first letter is "".

Hidden Prompt ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

This works similarly to Command Prompt On Cue by Ron Newcomb, but is (almost) pure I7 and thus unlikely to break with new updates. The most important phrases are these:
	hide the command prompt
This makes the command prompt invisible until the player attempts to type a command.
	hide the command prompt with implicit command (T - text)
This is the same as the above, but supplies T instead of "wait" if the player doesn't type anything.
	show the command prompt
If the player never interrupted, this ends the sequence.
