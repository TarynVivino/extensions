With this extension installed, failed actions take no time and successful implicit actions do; that is, if you enter the commands "drop watch", "eat watch", "eat watch" in sequence, the first eating attempt will take a turn (because the player picks up the watch before realizing that it's inedible) but the second does not (because he already carries it). The phrase (and say-phrase) "take no time" causes a successful action to take no time as well, whereas "take full time" is the reverse. Neither of these will have any effect in a before, check, or instead rule; they are meant to be used at the carry out stage or later. Defining an action as "acting fast" does the same thing.
