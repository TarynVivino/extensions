This extension enables the player to use the commands ASK ABOUT TOPIC or TELL ABOUT TOPIC when in extended conversation with a single character. It will normally direct conversation to the last person talked to, but if only one other person is in the location, it will direct it to that person instead.

The extremely short forms A TOPIC and T TOPIC are also provided.

No special support in the main source text is needed; just include Assumed Conversers.
