Example: * Security Consultant
Description: Extracting useful information from an NPC.

	{*}"Security Consultant"

	Include Reactable Quips by Michael Martin.

	The Vault is a room. A guard is a man in the Vault. Some treasure is in the vault. The default tell quip of the guard is t_badpassword.

	Instead of taking the treasure, say "The guard holds up a hand. 'I can't let you touch that unless you tell me the password.'"

	Table of Ask Results (continued)
	NPC	topic	result
	guard	"name"	a_name
	guard	"treasure"	a_treasure
	guard	"password"	a_password
	guard	"job/guard"	a_job
	guard	"anglerfish"	a_fish

	Table of Tell Results (continued)
	NPC	topic	result
	guard	"password"	t_password
	guard	"anglerfish"	t_fish
	guard	"treasure"	a_treasure

	Table of Quip Texts (continued)
	quip	quiptext
	a_name	"'My name's Gordon.'"
	a_treasure	"'Pretty fantastic, isn't it?'"
	a_password	"'The password is [']anglerfish['].'"
	a_job	"'I'm a guard. I guard things.'"
	a_fish	"'That's kind of above my pay grade. I guess it's some kind of fish?'"
	t_fish	"'That's the password! Sure, you can have the treasure.'"
	t_password	"'No, no, you have to tell me the password, not tell me [']the password['].'"
	t_badpassword	"'Sorry, that's not the password.'"

	After quipping when the current quip is t_fish: end the story finally saying "You have discovered a fatal security flaw".

	Test me with "ask guard about name / take treasure / ask guard about guard / guard, sesame / guard, password / tell guard about treasure / ask guard about treasure / ask guard about password / say anglerfish to guard".

Note that most traditional syntaxes for talking to NPCs will translate to TELL actions. Also note that a single line of dialogue may be recycled across ASK and TELL or even across NPCs by referring to the same quip multiple times.
