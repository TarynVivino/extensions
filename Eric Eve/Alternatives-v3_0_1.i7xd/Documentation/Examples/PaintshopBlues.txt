Example: * Paintshop Blues
Description: Experimenting with the actions the player is prepared to perfom on differently coloured objects.

This is something of a toy example, and there's nothing it does that couldn't be done some other (and often better) way in Inform; nonetheless it serves to illustrate how this extension can be used.


Note once again what we must test "the colour of whatever" and not just "whatever" with these phrases. It would be pointless to have a clause like "when the noun is either red or blue" since this condition would not compile (and could not be met even if it did compile).

Although this is a toy example it does illustrate one or two situations where this extension might be useful. For example we could have achieved the same effect as the "Instead of dropping rule" for the cup and plate above with:

Definition: a thing is breakable if it is the china cup or if it is the china plate.

Instead of dropping something breakable, say "But it might break if you drop it!"

But this extension would save us the extra step of defining the breakable adjective, which might be useful if this were the only such case we wanted to catch.
