	Include Conversation Responses by Eric Eve.

	The Hall is a Room. "As befits a grand old manor house, the hall is imposingly large, with acres of polished wooden floorboards and scores of ancient family portraits hung about the walls."

	Some ancient family portraits are scenery in the Hall.
	Understand "ancestors" as the ancient family portraits.

	Bob is a man in the Hall. "Bob is standing in the middle of the hall, looking rather worried."

	After saying hello to Bob:
	say "'Hello there, Bob!'[paragraph break]'Good morning,' he replies."

	Response of Bob when asked about Bob:
	say "'[one of]How are you today? You look worried!' you remark.[paragraph break]'I've lost my wallet,' he tells you[make lost wallet known][or]Are you okay - apart from your wallet?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Fine, but I'm so worried about my wallet!' he replies[stopping]."

	Response of Bob when asked about the lost wallet:
	say "'Where did you last see your wallet?' you ask.[paragraph break]'I can't remember,' he replies."

	Response of Bob when asked-or-told about "[theft]" and the lost wallet is known:
	say "'[one of]Could your wallet have been stolen, do you think?' you ask.[paragraph break]'I don't know,' he answers miserably[or]Have you tried telling the police?' you suggest.[paragraph break]'No, I'd feel such a fool if it just turned up,' he replies[stopping]."

	Response of Bob when saying sorry and the lost wallet is known:
	say "'Well, I'm sorry you can't find your wallet,' you say.[paragraph break]'So am I,' he tells you."

	Response of Bob when asked-or-told about the ancient family portraits:
	say "'[one of]Who are all those people in the portraits?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Oh, just my ancestors. I expect half of them were hung for sheep-stealing,' he replies[or]I don't think your ancestors look that disreputable,' you remark.[paragraph break][make lost wallet known]'Never mind my ancestors - it's my wallet I'm worried about!' he replies[stopping]."

	Response of Bob when shown the silver dollar:
	say "'Is this any good to you?' you ask.[paragraph break]'One dollar?' he asks, 'Thanks, but no thanks. It's not the cash I'm so worried about, it's the credit cards!'"

	The silver dollar is carried by the player.

	The lost wallet is a thing.

	Understand "bob's" or "his" as the lost wallet.
	
	Understand "theft" or "thief" or "stolen" or "police" as "[theft]".
