	Part 1 - Additional rule for taking

	Rule for deciding whether all includes scenery: it does not.

	Part 2 - Scenario

	The Bedroom is a room. "There's little room in here for anything but the bed, the desk and a solitary chair."

	The bed is an enterable scenery supporter in the Bedroom.

	An underside called under#bed is part of the bed.

	An odd sock is wearable. It is in under#bed.

	The player is holding a red ball.

	After dropping the red ball in the Bedroom:
	move the red ball under the bed, making it hidden;
	say "The red ball falls to the floor and rolls under the bed."

	The chair is an enterable portable supporter in the Bedroom.
	A red sock is on the chair.
	The bulk of the chair is 11.

	An underside called under#chair is part of the chair.

	The book is in under#chair.
	The scarf is in under#chair.

	The desk is a scenery supporter in the Bedroom.
	An open underside called under#desk is part of the desk.

	The pen is a thing.

	Before looking under the desk when the pen is off-stage:
	move the pen under the desk.

	Test me with "Drop ball/look under bed/put red sock under bed/look under bed/take odd sock/take ball/take red sock/look under bed/take chair/look/take all/look under desk/take all".
