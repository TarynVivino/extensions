Example: * Lost Cheque
Description: A simple example of one thing hidden under another.

This example illustrates most of the principal features of the extension when used by itself (i.e. without Underside). Note how we provide our own definition of "To say find-hidden-under" to make the player automatically pick up anything found under the mat.

	{*}"Lost Cheque" by Eric Eve

	Include Hiding Under by Eric Eve.

	The Hall is a room.
	"[if unvisited]You know you dropped a cheque here somewhere; the question is where[otherwise]There's not much of interest here, really, apart from that cheque[end if]."

	The doormat is a portable enterable supporter in the Hall.
	"A brown doormat lies by the front door."

	Understand "brown" or "mat" as the doormat.

	The valuable cheque is hidden under the doormat.
	The description is "It's a cheque for ten thousand [if the American dialect option is active]dollars[otherwise]pounds[end if]."

	Understand "check" as the valuable cheque when the American dialect option is active.

	Rule for printing the name of the valuable cheque when the American dialect option is active: say "valuable check".

	Instead of looking under something when the player is on the noun:
	say "You'll have to get off [the noun] first."

	Instead of placing the valuable cheque under the doormat:
	hide the valuable cheque under the doormat;
	say "You slip the cheque back under the doormat."

	To say find-hidden-under (the doormat - a thing):
	now everything hidden under the doormat is carried by the player;
	say "Under the mat you find [a list of things hidden under the doormat], which you eagerly snatch up."

	Test me with "look under mat/i/x cheque/put cheque under mat/take mat"
