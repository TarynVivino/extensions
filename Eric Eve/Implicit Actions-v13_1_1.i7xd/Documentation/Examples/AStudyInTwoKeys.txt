Example: * A Study in Two Keys
Description: A demonstration of the various kinds of implicit action defined in the Implicit Actions extension.

This little game exhibits what Implicit Actions does straight out of the box, by offering examples of all the implicit actions it defines. The only extension-specific code in this game (beyond the Include statement) is "The matching key of the pine door is no-key", which means that we don't need a key to lock and unlock this door.

	{*}"A Study in Two Keys"

	Include Implicit Actions by Eric Eve.
	
	The Study is a Room. "A large wooden table stands to one side of the room, opposite a glass cabinet. An oak door leads south."

	The chair is an enterable scenery supporter in the Study.
	The player is on the chair.

	The large wooden table is a scenery supporter in the Study.

	The red box is a closed openable container. It is on the table.
	In the red box is a key called the silver key.

	A keyring called the gold keyring is on the table.

	The glass cabinet is a closed locked openable lockable transparent scenery container. It is in the study.
	The matching key of the glass cabinet is the silver key.
	A key called the brass key is in the glass cabinet.

	The oak door is a closed locked scenery door. It is south of the Study and north of the Hall.
	The matching key of the oak door is the brass key.

	The Hall is a Room. "This room is quite bare, but an oak door leads north, and a pine door east."

	The pine door is a closed locked scenery door. It is east of the Hall and west of the Closet.
	The matching key of the pine door is no-key.

	The Closet is a Room. "This small closet is little more than a broom-cupboard (though there is not a broom in sight). A pine door leads out to the west."
	Instead of exiting in the Closet, try going west.
	
	Test me with "s/unlock door with brass key/look in red box/unlock glass cabinet with silver key/unlock oak door with brass key/s/e/lock door/out/n/lock door/drop all/close red box/put silver key in red box/put brass key in cabinet/lock cabinet/drop silver key/sit on chair/take gold/s/put brass on gold/lock oak"

When you've tried running this example, you might like to try it again with the following added, to see the difference in reporting style:

	{*}when play begins:
	now parenthesize implicit actions is false.
