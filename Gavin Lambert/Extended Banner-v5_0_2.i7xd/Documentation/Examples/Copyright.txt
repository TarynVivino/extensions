Example: * Copyright
Description: Adding some copyright text to the banner.

To add a copyright line to the banner, you don't have to write a rule like the one above. Instead, you can define the story copyright string with the year or years for which you're claming copyright:

	{*}"Copyright" by Gavin Lambert
	
	Include Extended Banner by Gavin Lambert.
	
	The story copyright string is "2022".

	There is a room.
