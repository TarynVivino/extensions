This is a trivial extension to the standard Rideable Vehicles by Graham Nelson (and includes that, so you only need include this one), that simply rejiggers the rule about standing up before going such that rideable vehicles and animals behave better in the presence of other supporters.

It was inspired by the thread https://intfiction.org/t/limiting-requiring-vehicle-use/45634/5.

The "Back to the Hoverboard" example was inspired by Matt Weiner's post in the same thread.
