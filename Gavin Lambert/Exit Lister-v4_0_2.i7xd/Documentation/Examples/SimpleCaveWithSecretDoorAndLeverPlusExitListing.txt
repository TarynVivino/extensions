Example: * Simple Cave with Secret Door and Lever, plus Exit Listing
Description: Secret Doors example plus Exit Listing

For ease of testing the different behaviour, this example also asks the player whether they want to see exits listed when play begins; normally this can just be left to the default.

	{*}"Secret Cave Passage with Listed Exits" by Gavin Lambert

	Include Secret Doors by Gavin Lambert.
	Include Exit Lister by Gavin Lambert.

	Big Cave is a room. "You're not sure how you ended up here, but you're surrounded on all sides by slightly damp rock.  Fortunately the walls seem to contain faintly glowing moss, so there's enough light to see by."
	The faintly glowing moss is scenery in the Big Cave.  "It glows just barely enough to make out your surroundings."

	Secret Passage is a room. "For being so close to a cave, this passage is surprisingly well built and is lit by standard electrical bulbs.  Unfortunately it also appears to be blocked by rubble not too far from the entrance; you can't seem to proceed any further."
	The rubble is scenery in the Secret Passage.  "It looks completely impassable."

	The passage door is an unopenable secret door.  "It's fairly unassuming.  You'd never have known it was there until it opened."
	It is west of the Big Cave and east of the Secret Passage.

	The hidden lever is a secret switch in the Big Cave.  "Nestled almost invisibly between two rocks in the cave wall.  [if the passage door is revealed]It has been pulled downwards.[otherwise]It points invitingly upwards.[end if]"

	The cave wall is scenery in the Big Cave.  "Nothing else more interesting presents itself.  Just more glowing moss."
	Understand "damp rock" or "rock" as the cave wall.

	Instead of searching or examining the cave wall for the first time:
		now the lever is revealed;
		say "As you examine the cave wall, in a gap between two rocks you discover a lever."
		
	Instead of pulling or pushing the revealed lever:
		if the passage door is revealed:
			say "You don't have any desire to close the passage again.";
		otherwise:
			now the passage door is revealed;
			now the passage door is open;
			say "A secret door opens with a rumble, revealing a secret passage in the west wall!"

	When play begins:
		say "Do you want a list of possible exits at the end of the room description?";
		if player consents, try turning exits on;
		otherwise try turning exits off;
		say "[paragraph break]You can always turn the exit list on or off with the commands EXITS ON and EXITS OFF. You can also always ask for an exit list with the command EXITS.[paragraph break]";

	[The first of these is for testing interactively, as when pasting this example.  The others are for automated testing in an extension project.]
	Test me with "w / x door / pull lever / x wall / pull lever / w".
	[Test me with "y / w / x door / pull lever / x wall / pull lever / w".]
	[Test me with "n / w / x door / pull lever / x wall / pull lever / w".]
