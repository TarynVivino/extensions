Example: * The Sweet Life
Description: Also hiding under a bed, but with more drama.

	{*}"The Sweet Life" by Eric Conrad

	Include Enterable Underside by Gavin Lambert.

	Understand "hide under/underneath [something]" as entering underneath.

	Bedroom is a room.

	The bed is an enterable supporter.  It is in the bedroom.  The player is on the bed.  Angelina is a woman on the bed.

	The under#bed is an underside.  It is part of the bed.  It is enterable and transparent.

	The shoebox is a container.  It is in the under#bed.  Roberto is a man.  He is in the under#bed.

	After looking under the bed for the first time:
		say "'Angelina?  How could you -- with Roberto?'".

	[ Two normal people can just fit under the bed provided there is nothing else there. ]
	The bulk of a person is usually 5.

	When play begins:
		now the story viewpoint is first person singular;
		say "[italic type](Dedicated to those dubbed Italian comedies from the early 1970s)[roman type][paragraph break]The door to the apartment slams shut.  From the hallway, the voice calls out 'Mi amore, I'm home.'  Panic-stricken, Angelina looks at me and whispers 'It's Giovanni.  Quickly, you must hide!'  Giovanni's steps grow softer as he walks toward the kitchen.  She breathes a sigh of relief as we hear the refrigerator open.  'Now hide.'  She points down, under the bed.".

	Arrival is a scene.  Arrival begins when the player is in the under#bed.

	When arrival begins:
		say "As Giovanni enters the bedroom, he says, 'Mia cara!  It's so fine to be home.'  Angelina answers, 'O Giovanni, I missed you so.  Please buy some wine to celebrate!'[paragraph break]As her husband leaves for the store, she says, 'Both of you, out!'";
		try Roberto exiting.

	Test me with "exit / look under bed / hide under bed / take shoebox / hide under bed / exit".
