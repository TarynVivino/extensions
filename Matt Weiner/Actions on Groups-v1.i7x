Version 1 of Actions on Groups by Matt Weiner begins here.

"Allows us to make certain actions apply to an entire player-specified group all at once, rather than applying serially to each member of the group."

Section 1 - The Multiple Actions Flag

Multiple actions already taken is a truth state that varies. [Will be used to block the action on groups from running for every object in the multiple object list after the first, and also for blocking the ordinary processing of the action.]

An action-processing rule when multiple actions already taken is true (this is the multiple actions preempt ordinary actions rule):
	stop the action.		

Every turn (this is the reset multiple actions flag rule): 
	now multiple actions already taken is false.

The multiple actions preempt ordinary actions rule is listed after the check for group action rule in the action-processing rulebook. [This stops the ordinary action from running when a group action has been performed.]

Section 2 - The Action On Groups Rulebook

Action on groups is a rulebook. Action on groups has default success. 

An action-processing rule when the current action is groupable action and the multiple object list is not empty and multiple actions already taken is false (this is the check for group action rule):
	follow the action on groups rules for the action name part of the current action;
	if rule succeeded or rule failed: [but not if there is no outcome, which will happen if no action on groups rule runs or the rules that run make no decision]
		now multiple actions already taken is true.

The check for group action rule is listed before the announce items from multiple object lists rule in the action-processing rulebook. [Could list it "first" but I want to leave open the possibility of another extension putting another rule first--all we need is to guarantee that it winds up before the announce items rule.]

The announce items from multiple object lists rule does nothing when multiple actions already taken is true. [So the ordinary processing of the actions doesn't print the names of everything in the multiple object list.] 

Section 3 - Group-Only Action

[If an action is group-only, then an attempt to carry it out with a multiple object list that is not one of the designated groups will fail, rather than serially executing the action for each object in the list.]

Last action on groups rule when the current action is group-only action (this is the can't use undesignated groups rule):
	say "Sorry, you can't do that with all those things at once." (A);
	rule fails. 
	
[Note that if you define other action on groups rules for group-only actions in the main source code, they will wind up after this one. So be careful!]

Section 4 - New Phrases

[so we can use the standard syntax: An action on groups for [action] when dealing with [list]:]

To decide whether dealing with (list one - a list of objects):
	let list two be the multiple object list;
	repeat with tester running through list one:
		if tester is not listed in list two:
			no;
	repeat with tester running through list two:
		if tester is not listed in list one:
			no;
	yes.

[An action on groups for [action] when dealing with [description]; this will fire whenever *any* object we're dealing with matches the description]

To decide whether dealing with (OS - description of objects):
	repeat with item running through the list of OS:
		if item is listed in the multiple object list, yes;
	no.

[An action on groups for [action] when dealing only with [description]: this will fire whenever *every* object we're dealing with matches the description. And there has to be at least one, or the action on groups rule never gets called.]

To decide whether dealing only with (OS - description of objects):
	repeat with item running through the multiple object list:
		unless item matches OS, no;
	yes.

[In case we want to redirect an action to a single action, so we have to clear the multiple object list.]

To clear the multiple object list:
	alter the multiple object list to {}.	
	
[But if we want to redirect to a new multiple action, a bit more preparation is needed. This phrase is particularly designed for use in Action on Groups rules, when we might want to change the multiple object list and then pass through to ordinary action processing.]

To prepare to act on/with (new list - list of objects), as nouns or as second nouns:
	alter the multiple object list to new list;
	let item be entry 1 in new list;
	if as second nouns:
		now the second noun is item;
	otherwise: [the "as the nouns" option doesn't do anything, but it's included for symmetry]
		now the noun is item;
	now the current item from the multiple object list is item.	

Section 5 - Serial And Fix (for use without Serial And Fix by Andrew Plotkin)

[This just is Andrew Plotkin's code that sometimes circulates under the name Serial And Fix. It allows comprehension of things like "PUT GLASS, VASE, AND PITCHER ON TABLE" rather than requiring "PUT GLASS, VASE AND PITCHER ON TABLE." Strictly speaking it's not necessary for this extension, and is useful even without this extension, but I figure that people using this extension are particularly likely to want to be able to understand the serial and.]

Include (- 
[ SquashSerialAnd
	ix jx lastwd wd addr len changedany;
	
	for (ix=1 : ix<= num_words : ix++) {
		wd = WordFrom(ix, parse);
		
		if (lastwd == comma_word && wd == AND1__WD) {
			addr = WordAddress(ix);
			len = WordLength(ix);
			for (jx=0 : jx<len : jx++) {
				addr->jx = ' ';
			}
			
			changedany++;
		}
		lastwd = wd;
	}
	
	return changedany;
];
-).

To squash serial ands:
	(- if (SquashSerialAnd()) { 
		VM_Tokenise(buffer,parse);
		num_words = WordCount();
		players_command = 100 + WordCount();
	}; -)

After reading a command:
	squash serial ands.

Section 6 - A Null Action

[we need to define an action that is groupable action and group-only action, so the Inform compiler will recognize those as kinds of action.]

Null acting is an action applying to one thing.
Null acting is groupable action.
Null acting is group-only action.

Actions on Groups ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

PURPOSE OF EXTENSION

Ordinarily in Inform 7, once we have specified that "marry [things]" is to be understood as marrying, the command "MARRY DOMINIQUE AND DEVIN" would produce an output somewhat like this:
	
	Dominique: Married.
	Devin. Married.

If the player is officiating at a wedding ceremony rather than practicing plural marriage, we might want an output more like:
	
	You marry Dominique and Devin to each other.

And we would like the effects of this action to operate on Dominique and Devin as a pair rather than first on Dominique and then on Devin; they should wind up related by marriage, rather than each of them acquiring a separate "married" property.

Actions on Groups allows us to make certain actions apply to an entire player-specified group all at once, rather than applying serially to each member of the group. To do this we use a kind of action, groupable action, and a special rulebook, the Action on Groups rules. When groupable action is run on more than one object at once, the Action on Groups rules are checked. If any of the Action on Groups rules are run, then any further processing of the action is halted; the game will not print announcements such as "Dominique:" and will not run the normal Before-Instead-Check-Carry Out-After-Report rules for the action.

BASIC USE OF EXTENSION

To set up action on groups for an action, we must declare it as groupable action:
	
	Examining is groupable action.

We must create an Understand token to allow it to apply to multiple things, if it is not already so defined in the Standard Rules:

	Understand "examine [things]" as examining.

And we must create one or more Action on Groups rules for the action:
	
	Action on groups rule for examining:

The Action on Groups rulebook has default outcome success, so if one Action on Groups rule runs, no other such rules will run; unless we tell the rule to allow the rulebook to continue by invoking a "make no decision" phrase at the appropriate point. If the Action on Groups rulebook ends in success or failure, then the "multiple actions already taken" truth state will be set to true; this will suppress all further processing of actions that turn and will prevent the announcements of the individual items from the multiple object list from printing. 

The list of items specified by the player is the multiple object list (see ยง21.6 of Writing with Inform). If we want to write rules that apply only when a given list has been specified, we can use the phrase "when dealing with"; "dealing with L" is true when L is a list that contains all and only the objects in the multiple object list. So a rule beginning:

	Action on groups rule for marrying when dealing with {Dominique, Devin}:

would fire in response to "MARRY DOMINIQUE AND DEVIN" but not in response to "MARRY DOMINIQUE, DEVIN AND ALEX." See Example C below for examples of "dealing with" rules.

We can also write rules that fire whenever the multiple object list contains anything meeting a certain description, so that:

	Action on groups rule for putting something on the table when dealing with a glass:

will fire when we put multiple things on the table, and at least one is a glass.

And we can write rules that fire whenever the multiple object list contains only items meeting a certain description, so that:

	Action on groups rule for putting something on the table when dealing only with glasses:

will fire when we put multiple glasses on the table, but nothing else. (The difference between this and "...when dealing with the list of glasses" is that this rule will fire even if we are not putting every glass on the table.)

It is important to write "Action on groups rule for putting something on the table when dealing with a glass" rather than "Action on groups rule for putting a glass on the table"; the latter rule will only fire if the first object in the multiple object rule is a glass. When you want a rule heading to specify something about the multiple objects being acted on, always use one of the "dealing with" phrases or something that directly refers to the multiple object list.

GROUP-ONLY ACTION

We can specify a groupable action as group-only action:

	Quizzing it about is group-only action.

The Action on Groups rulebook for group-only actions is backstopped by the can't use undesignated groups rule, which prints a refusal to act on multiple objects. The idea is that a group-only action does not work on arbitrary groups, but only when the group the player's command picks out is a group ithatf the author has written a rule for dealing with. If the player's command picks out a different group, so that none of the author's Action on Groups rules fires, then the extension will print a refusal to act on multiple objects and stop all further processing of the actions. See "Sword Talk" for an example of group-only action.

REDIRECTING ACTIONS

The multiple object list governs whether or not we are acting on groups, and what groups we are acting on. If we wish to invoke a group action from within another rule, we must first alter the multiple object list to the list we wish to act on, and then try the action we wish on some entry of that list. Example C below demonstrates this; when searching a supporter that supports multiple items, we redirect the action to examining the contents of the supporter.

If we wish to invoke a non-group action from within a group action, we must first empty out the multiple object list. Example A below demonstrates this; when quizzing the swordsmith about the list of swords, we redirect the action to quizzing the swordsmith about the ideal sword. We must first empty the multiple object list, or Inform will treat "try quizzing the swordsmith about the ideal sword" as if it were an action on the list of swords, and we will enter an infinite loop.

A custom phrase is provided for emptying the multiple object list:

	clear the multiple object list.
	
If we wish to modify the multiple object list and then continue processing the action using the normal multiple object machinery, we should do this:

	prepare to act on (whatever the new list is);
	continue the action.

The "prepare to act" phrase changes the multiple object list to the new list, and also changes the noun and the current item from the multiple object list to the first item of the new list, so that Inform is ready to begin processing the multiple actions normally. Simply changing the multiple object list would lead to undesirable behavior. Example C demonstrates these kinds of redirection. 

If the multiple object list is in the second noun place (for instance, if we had written "SHOW JEWEL TO AISHA, BARRY, AND CLEON"), then we should use the phrase option "as second nouns":

	prepare to act on (new list), as second nouns;
	continue the action.

CAUTIONS

As mentioned above, do not try to write a rule beginning "Action on groups rule for taking a rock:"; write "Action on groups rule for taking when dealing with a rock:". The first rule would only apply when the first item in the multiple object list is a rock. 

Do not use "stop the action" or "...instead" in an Action on Groups rule, unless you want to proceed with the standard way of processing the action serially for each object in the multiple object list; use "rule fails" instead. In order for the multiple actions already taken flag to be set, the Action on Groups rulebook must end in success or failure. "Stop the action" and "...instead" cause the specific rule that is running to end in failure, but terminate the rulebook with no decision. "Rule fails" ends both the specific rule and the rulebook in failure, which will cause the flag to be set properly and will terminate any further action processing that turn.

If you are trying another action from within an Action on Groups rule, be very careful to properly prepare the multiple object list! If your new action is an action on a single object, clear the multiple object list before trying it; otherwise the new action will be processed as a multiple action (which could well cause an infinite loop). If the new action is a multiple action, prepare to act on the new list; simply changing the multiple object list could have strange results if the action being tried gets out of sync with the multiple object list. 

If you wish more than one Action on Groups rule to run in a turn, for instance to check the group action in one rule and carry it out in another rule, then the first rules must end in "make no decision" in order to allow the next rule to run. But some rule must end in a decision, or the multiple actions already taken flag will not be set and normal action processing will not be preempted. Since Action on Groups rules have default success, it should be enough to ensure that some rule that does not contain the "make no decision" phrase runs if the rulebook is not cut off earlier with "rule fails."

Some of the more complicated things that one might wish to try with Actions on Groups can require very delicate handling of the success and failure of the rulebooks. See the implementation of "The Facts Were These, Refactored" (at http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=19285) for an example. Use with care. This is a reimplementation of the example "The Facts Were These" from the Inform documentation, using Actions on Groups to handle the new multiple actions.

Thanks to Bjรถrn Paulsen, bg, and Daniel Stelzer for advice, suggestions, and encouragement, and to Bjรถrn and bg for some of the example code. Comments and suggestions can be sent to matt@mattweiner.net.

EXAMPLES

Example A, "Sword Talk," demonstrates a simple case of group only action. We would like the swordsmith to respond to "ask smith about swords" with chat about the ideal sword, but 
	
	Understand "swords" as the ideal sword.

will not work; the parser will understand "swords" as the plural of sword anyway. We define quizzing as a groupable action, so that "ask smith about swords" will result in quizzing the smith about the list of swords, and write a rule for dealing with quizzing when dealing with the list of swords. (Note that we must clear the multiple object list so this action is not itself treated as multiple.) We also define quizzing as group-only action, so any other attempt to ask about multiple things will fail. (Since there is no "[any things]" token as of Inform 6L38, we have to engage in a bit of trickery to add the off-stage things to scope when quizzing; the "[any things]" token is planned for future releases.) Most of the code for "Sword Talk" is by Bjรถrn Paulsen.

Example B, "Matrimony," allows us to marry two people at a time to each other. We write a series of Action on Groups rules to check that we are only marrying people, that we are marrying exactly two people, and so on. As discussed above, the initial rules must invoke "rule fails" when they fail, and must end with "make no decision" in order to allow the rulebook to proceed to the next rule; but the final rule must not end in "make no decision." Every rule is marked "Last" to ensure that they run in source code order (which is the order we want).

Example C, "Glasses," demonstrates a way of consolidating some of the actions and processing the rest normally. The action on groups rule for dealing with a glass first puts all the glasses on the table, counts how many there were, and prints an appropriate message for them. Anything else in the multiple object list is collated in Extras. If there is one such item, we print the name of the item and then try putting it on the table (first clearing the multiple object list so it is not processed as a multiple action). If there is more than one such item, we invoke the phrase "prepare to act on Extras" before continuing the action, so the rest of the action will be processed as a normal multiple action on Extras. IMPORTANT: This style of example only works if there is no way to fail to put a glass on the table. If a glass could fail to be put on the table, then we would have to know the result of the action before we knew whether to report the glass as part of the original group or put it in Extras. This extension provides no facility for doing that.

				replace the regular expression "(.*)[name-text entry](.*)" in N with "\1[Y]\2";
			change the text of the player's command to N.
	
	Report taking something:

	Section 2 - Scenario
	
	Eight-Walled Chamber is a room. "A perfectly octagonal room whose walls are tinted in various hues."
	
	The display table is a supporter in the Chamber. A twig of rowan wood is on the table.
	
	The player carries an apple and a pear.
	
	A glove is a kind of thing. A glove is always wearable. Understand "glove" as a glove. The player carries a left glove and a right glove. The left glove and the right glove are gloves.
	
	[Now we define a few actual lists of items:]
	
	Fruit list is a list of things which varies. Fruit list is { apple, pear }.
	Glove list is a list of things which varies. Glove list is { right glove, left glove }.
	Arcane list is a list of things which varies. Arcane list is { left glove, twig, pear }.
	
	Table of Collective Names
	name-text	relevant list
	"left hand of autumn"	"[arcane list]"
	"gloves"	"[glove list]"
	"pair of gloves"	"[glove list]"
	
	Test me with "x apple and pear / x left and right / put pear on table / put left glove on table / x all on table / put all on table / examine all on table / get apple, twig, pear / x all on table / search table".
	
	Section 3 - Handling the Scenario with Action on Groups
	
	Understand "examine [things]" as examining. 
	
	Examining it from is an action applying to two things.
	
	Understand "examine [things inside] in/on [something]" or "look at [things inside] in/on [something]" as examining it from. [As in the original example, we can use this to capture "look at everything on the table"; but now we can redirect it to simple examining, and use the action on groups rules to take care of the case where the things on the table form a special group.]
	
	Examining is groupable action. Examining something from something is groupable action.
	
	An action on groups rule for examining something from something:
		try examining the noun. [This will trigger the action on groups rules for examining; and since the rule for examining it from fires before the announce items rule, examining it from will not trigger announcments from the multiple object lists]
	
	Carry out examining it from: try examining the noun instead. [This will be invoked when there is only a single item involved.]
	
	An action on groups rule for examining when dealing with the fruit list:
		say "Just a couple of fruits."
		
	An action on groups rule for examining when dealing with the glove list:
		say "It's a matched pair of fuzzy blue gloves."
		
	An action on groups rule for examining when dealing with the arcane list:
		say "To anyone else it might look like a random collection of objects, but these three things -- [multiple object list with definite articles] -- constitute a mystic key known as the Left Hand of Autumn. They practically hum with power."
		
	Last action on groups rule for examining:
		say "You see [multiple object list with indefinite articles]." 
		
	Understand "look on [something]" as searching.
	
	[The original example had a phrase for describing a list, which was invoked both by multiple examining and by searching a container/supporter that contained/supported multiple things. We can accomplish the same thing by hand-changing the multiple object list to the list of things in/on the container/supporter, and then examining the first one--which will behave just as if the player had typed "EXAMINE ALL ON TABLE."]
	
	Instead of searching something which supports at least two things:
		let L be the list of things supported by the noun;
		alter the multiple object list to L;
		try examining entry 1 of L.
		
	Instead of searching something which contains at least two things:
		let L be the list of things contained by the noun;
		alter the multiple object list to L;
		try examining entry 1 of L.
