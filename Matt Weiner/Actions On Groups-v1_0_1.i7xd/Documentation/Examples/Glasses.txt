	Section 1 - Grouping Rules
	
	Putting something on something is a groupable action.
	
	Action on groups rule for putting something on the table when dealing with the list of glasses:
		now every glass is on the table;
		say "You haphazardly set every glass on the table."
	
	Action on groups rule for putting something on the table when dealing with a glass:
		let G be a number;
		let Extras be a list of things;
		repeat with item running through the multiple object list:
			if item is a glass:
				increment G;
				now the item is on the table;
			otherwise:
				add item to Extras;
		say "You carefully set [if G is 1]one glass[otherwise][G in words] glasses[end if] on the table.";
		if the number of entries in Extras is 0:
			rule succeeds;
		if the number of entries in Extras is 1:
			let item be entry 1 in Extras;
			clear the multiple object list;
			if G > 0:
				say "[line break][item]: [run paragraph on]";
			try putting item on the table;
			rule succeeds;
		otherwise if the number of entries in Extras > 1:
			prepare to act on Extras;
			continue the action.
	
	Section 2 - Scenario
			
	A glass is a kind of thing.
	The player carries a pitcher, six glasses, and a vase of flowers.
	
	Dining Area is a room.
	A table is a supporter in Dining Area.
	
	Test me with "put two glasses on the table / look / put three glasses and the pitcher on the table / look / take all / put four glasses and the vase and the pitcher on the table / look / take all / put the vase and the pitcher and four glasses on the table / look / take all glasses / put all glasses on table / take all/ put all glasses and vase on table".
