This is a simple extension to simplify rolling dice and adding them up. Simply use 'd' with the number of dice on the left and the number of sides on the right, as is common convention. You must have whitespace around the 'd'.

E.g., 3 d 6 totals 3 six-sided dice, while 4 d 8 + 7 totals 4 eight-sided dice (and then adds 7 to that result). The value of 10 d 1 + 2 will be 12 every time, since a 1-sided die always produces 1.
