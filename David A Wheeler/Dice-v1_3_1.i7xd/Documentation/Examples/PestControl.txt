	"Pest Control" by David A Wheeler

	Include Dice by David A Wheeler.

	[Significants parts below are derived from the "Randomness" section example "Lanista 1"]

	A person has a number called current hit points.

	The Dragon's Lair is a room. "This is a beautiful airy room."
	An animal called Malevilness the Red Dragon is here.
	The description of Malevilness is "Malevilness the Red Dragon is taller than 3 men, and there's always room in his stomach for one more."

	When play begins:
		now the current hit points of the player is 5 d 8;
		now the current hit points of Malevilness is 5 d 8;
		now the left hand status line is "You: [current hit points of player]";
		now the right hand status line is "Dragon: [current hit points of Malevilness]".

	Instead of attacking someone:
		let the damage be 3 d 6;
		say "You attack [the noun], causing [damage] points of damage!";
		decrease the current hit points of the noun by the damage;
		if the current hit points of the noun is less than 0:
			say "[line break][The noun] expires!";
			now the noun is nowhere;
			end the story finally;
			stop the action;
		let the enemy damage be 2 d 4;
		say "[line break][The noun] attacks you, causing [enemy damage] points of damage!";
		decrease the current hit points of the player by the enemy damage;
		if the current hit points of the player is less than 0:
			say "[line break]You expire!";
			end the story.

	Test me with "hit dragon / g / g / g".
