When this is included, the game will automatically prompt for a transcript file
at the start of the game *unless* you:

	use manual transcript start.

It facilitates the long-time standard of beta testers using '*' to leave
comments in the transcript, but with a polite "(Noted.)" instead of a
"That's not a verb I recognize." error.

If the transcript is not already on, upon the first use of '*', it's
automatically turned on.
