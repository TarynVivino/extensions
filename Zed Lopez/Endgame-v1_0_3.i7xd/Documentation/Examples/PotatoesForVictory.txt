Example: * Potatoes for Victory

	{*}"Potatoes for Victory"

	Include Endgame by Zed Lopez.

	Lab is a room.

	The player carries the foil-jacketed potato.
	The oven is an open container in the lab.

	After inserting the potato into the oven: end the game.

	Amusing is an action out of world.
	Amusing is an endgame action.
	Understand "amusing" as amusing when game over.
	Carry out amusing: say "Try putting the potato in the oven."

	when play begins:
	now the standard endgame question rule response (A) is "You won! Would you like to Restore, Restart, Quit, or see Amusing things to have tried?";
	now the endgame block disallowed actions rule response (A) is "Only Restore, Restart, Quit, or Amusing are available.";

	test me with "x self / verify / put potato in oven / x self / look / verify / amusing / quit".
