Example: * The Lab
Description: A basic example.

We'd like to implement a chemistry lab, so we go ahead and create a lab and a lab bench.  Immediately, we have some great ideas, but we don't know quite what to do with them so we write them down to come back to later.  A quick test reveals a serious bug, but we want to keep putting the lab together so we note it down to fix later.  We make it a STOPSHIP so it has a higher priority, meaning that it will be printed first when we next run the game.

	Include Debug Tags by Michael Kielstra.

	The Lab is a room.  The lab bench is in the Lab.  The chemical box is in the lab.  It is an openable open container.  The chemical phial is in the chemical box.

	IMPLEMENT CHEMICAL MIXING/ALCHEMY SYSTEM is a TODO.
	MAYBE ADD SOME PHENOLPHTHALEIN - I LOVE PHENOLPHTHALEIN is an IDEA.
	
	PLAYER CANNOT PUT PHIAL ON LAB BENCH is a STOPSHIP.
		
	Test me with "take phial / put chemical phial on lab bench".
