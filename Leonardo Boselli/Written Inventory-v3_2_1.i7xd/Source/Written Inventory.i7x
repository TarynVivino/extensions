Version 3.2.1 of Written Inventory by Leonardo Boselli begins here.

"Just Version 3 of Written Inventory by Jon Ingold made adaptive. Provides a framework for listing inventories in natural sentences. Separates carried and worn objects, followed by objects that contains other objects. What's listed in the third section is customisable via a rulebook."  


Encasement relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is part of Y or X is held by Y. The verb to be encased by implies the encasement relation.

Definition: a container is empty if the number of things in it is zero. 
Definition: a supporter is empty if the number of things on it is zero. 
Definition: a thing is empty if the number of things encased by it is zero.

Definition: a thing is non-empty if it is not empty.
