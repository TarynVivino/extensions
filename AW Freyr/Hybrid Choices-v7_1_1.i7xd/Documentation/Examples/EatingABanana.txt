Example: ** Eating a Banana
Description: A simple demonstration of item-invoking and how it might be implemented in a large project.

	{*}"Eating a Banana" by AW Freyr

	Include Hybrid Choices by AW Freyr.

	A thing has an object called the item menu. The item menu is usually nothing.

	Check item-invoking something:
		if the item menu of the noun is not a page:
			say "[The noun] [are] not very interesting." instead.

	Carry out item-invoking something:
		turn to item menu of the noun.

	The block item-invoking rule is not listed in the report item-invoking rulebook.

	The banana is a thing carried by the player. The item menu is b1.

	b1 is a page. It is a dead-end.
	"You eat the banana."

	A page-toggle rule for b1:
		now the banana is off-stage.

	p1 is a page.
	"You get the feeling there's no way out except eating a banana."

	The blue room is a room.

	After looking for the first time:
		now the item-invoking disabled is false;
		switch to cyoa at p1.
