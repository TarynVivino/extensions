Example: * Lamplighter
Description: A very simple scenario with a wall-plugged lamp that lights when turned on.

	{*}"Lamplighter"

	Include Power Sources by Emily Short.

	Salon is a room. A lamp is a device in the Salon. "A lamp [if lit]shines brightly[otherwise]sits[end if] here." The lamp incorporates a PS-plug.

	The Salon contains a wall socket.

	When play begins:
		let spot be a random wall socket in the Salon;
		if spot is a wall socket:
			silently try plugging the lamp into spot.
			
	Carry out switching on the lamp:
		now the lamp is lit.
	
	Carry out switching off the lamp:
		now the lamp is unlit.

	Test me with "look / turn on lamp / look / unplug lamp / look / turn on lamp / plug in lamp / turn on lamp / unplug lamp / plug lamp into wall socket".
