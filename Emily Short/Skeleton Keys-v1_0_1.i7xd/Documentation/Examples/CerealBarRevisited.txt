	{*}"Cereal Bar Revisited"

	Include Locksmith by Emily Short. Include Skeleton Keys by Emily Short.

	

	The player carries a passkey called the tin key. The tin key unlocks the tin box. The tin box is closed, openable, lockable, and locked. In the box is a single Cheerio.

	

	Cereality is a room. "The newly-opened 'cereal bar' allows you to mix and match cereal types at will." The box is in Cereality.

	

	The passkey description rule is not listed in any rulebook.



	The description of a passkey is usually "[if the item described unbolts something][The item described] unlocks [the list of things unbolted by the item described][otherwise]You have yet to discover what [the item described] unlocks[end if]."

	The player carries a skeleton key. Every thing is unlocked by the skeleton key.



	Test me with "i / x key / unlock box / i / x key".
