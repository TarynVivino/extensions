Example: * Boatman
Description: A sample involving modified descriptions for items in an enterable container with the player.

	{*}"Boatman"

	Include Tailored Room Description by Emily Short.

	The Salt Lake is a room.

	The rowboat is an enterable container in the Salt Lake. Understand "boat" as the rowboat. It contains a boatman, a pole, and a bottle of fresh water. The boatman is a man.

	The Salt Lake contains a single flipper.

	A ranking rule for the boatman: increase the description-rank of the boatman by 10.

	Rule for writing a paragraph about the boatman when the boatman is in the rowboat:
		if entering the rowboat, say "[The boatman] leans to one side to provide balance as you scramble in. [paragraph break]";
		otherwise say "[The boatman] sits in [the rowboat], looking grim. [paragraph break]"

	Rule for writing a paragraph about something while entering a container (called special-target):
		say "In [the special-target] with you, you see [the list of mentionable things in the special-target]."

	Rule for writing a paragraph about a deeply dull thing which is in the rowboat when the player is in the rowboat:
		say "In the bottom of the boat, you see [a list of deeply dull mentionable things which are in the rowboat]. [paragraph break]".

	Rule for writing a paragraph about a deeply dull thing which is in the Salt Lake:
		say "Floating on the impossibly buoyant water: [a list of deeply dull mentionable things which are in the Salt Lake]. [paragraph break]".

	Test me with "get flipper / put flipper in rowboat / look / enter rowboat / get pole / look / get water / look / out / look / drop all / look / get in boat / look".
