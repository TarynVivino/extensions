	{*}"Changing Room"
	
	Include Facing by Emily Short.

	The Changing Room is a room. The white door is north of the Changing Room and south of the Hallway. The white door is a door. Clark is a man in the changing room. A persuasion rule: persuasion succeeds. The closet door is west of the changing room and east of the Storage Closet. The closet door is a door. It is closed and locked.
	
	The sliding glass door is a door. It is southeast of the changing room and northwest of the Patio. It is transparent.
	
	Rule for distantly describing the hallway:
		say "Off in the hallway, you make out a steady stream of auditioners coming and going; some looking tense, some relieved."
		
	Rule for distantly describing a room (called target) when the occluding door is closed and the occluding door is transparent:
		let N be indexed text;
		now N is "[the target]";
		say "Through the glass of [the occluding door], you make out [N in lower case]."
