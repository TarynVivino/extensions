Example: * Easy Keys
Description: Demonstrating how to use Approaches with Locksmith to create doors that properly bar the player's travel.

Approaches is designed to work together with Locksmith to produce sensible messages when the player stops in the middle of going somewhere because of a locked door. Conversely, if the player does have the correct keys, he will automatically unlock, open, and move through any doors that stand in his way, without special comment.

The only trick to bear in mind here is that we must use the "sequential action" option; otherwise, Locksmith will print "(first unlocking the hut door)" sorts of messages at inappropriate points in our action reporting.

So for example:

	{*}"Easy Keys"

	Include Locksmith by Emily Short.
	Include Approaches by Emily Short.

	Seamus' Hut is a room.

	South of Seamus' Hut is the hut door. The hut door is a door. It is lockable and unlocked. The tiny key unlocks the hut door. The player carries the tiny key.

	South of the hut door is an Open Field.

	South of the open field is Woodland.

	supercrediting is an action out of world.
	understand "supercredits" as supercrediting.
	carry out supercrediting: say the complete list of extension credits.

	Test me with "s / lock door / s / drop key / go to Hut / go to woodland / get key / go to Hut".

	Section Key knowledge (for use with Implicit Actions by Eric Eve)

	The known-key of the hut door is the tiny key.

	Section Sequential (for use with Locksmith by Emily Short)
	
	Use sequential action.
