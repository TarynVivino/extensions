Example: ** Traveling with Candles
Description: Movement in which the player is not allowed to enter a dark room unless some light source is found inside or the player himself carries a light source.

This example is a little tricky in that we must invoke some of Inform's underlying machinery to check whether the room the player is about to enter in fact has a visible lightsource inside; otherwise, it is much the same as the previous example in setting special limits on the player's movement and printing the path description when necessary.

	{*}"Traveling with Candles"

	
	
	Include Approaches by Emily Short.
	
	The Living Room is a room. The Kitchen is north of the Living Room. The Basement is below the Kitchen. The Oubliette is south of the Basement.
	
	The Basement and the Oubliette are dark.
	
	Instead of going to a provisionally dark room (called danger spot) when the player does not enclose a lit thing:
		say "[path-walked so far]It looks dark in [the danger spot], [if the number of entries in the path so far of the player is greater than 0]though, [end if]so you stop";
		if the number of entries in the path so far of the player is greater than 0:
			say ".[no line break]";
		otherwise:
			say "."
	
	The player carries a lit thing called a candle.
	
	To decide whether (place - a room) finds light inside:
		(- ( OffersLight({place}) ) -)
	
	Definition: a room is internally lit if it finds light inside.
	
	Definition: a room is provisionally dark if it is not internally lit.
	
	Test me with "n / d / s / drop candle / go to Living Room / get candle / n / drop candle / s / go to living room / go to basement / get candle / go to living room / drop candle / go to oubliette".
