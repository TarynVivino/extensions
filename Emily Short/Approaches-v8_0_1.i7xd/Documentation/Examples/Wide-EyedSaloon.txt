Example: * Wide-Eyed Saloon
Description: Demonstrating how to safely interrupt the player's travel with conditions other than locked doors.



	{*}"Wide-Eyed Saloon"

	
	
	Include Approaches by Emily Short.

	Wide-Eyed Saloon is a room.

	North of Wide-Eyed Saloon is a Dusty Street.

	The Church is west of a Dusty Street.

	Instead of going to the church when the player does not carry the hymnal:
		say "[path-walked so far]Entry into the church is barred without a hymnal, unfortunately."
	
	The player carries the hymnal.

	Test me with "n / w / go to Saloon / drop hymnal / go to church / west".
