	The Verandah is a room. The table is a supporter in the verandah. The table supports a cocktail glass, a bottle, and a pitcher. The cocktail glass, the bottle, and the pitcher are fluid containers.

	The cocktail glass is preferred for drinking.

	The fluid capacity of the cocktail glass is 4.0 fl oz.
	The fluid capacity of the bottle is 33.8 fl oz. The fluid content of the bottle is 33.8 fl oz. The liquid of the bottle is fire vodka.
	The fluid capacity of the pitcher is 28.0 fl oz. The fluid content of the pitcher is 10.0 fl oz. The liquid of the pitcher is gunpowder juice.

	Last check pouring something into something:
		if the resulting liquid is exploding crantini:
			remove the noun from play;
			remove the second noun from play;
			say "When the liquids touch, there is an enormous BANG!, destroying 	both vessels and leaving you with soot all over your face." instead.

	Test me with "pour fire vodka in glass / drink fire vodka / fill glass / pour gunpowder juice in glass / drink gunpowder juice / drink fire vodka / pour gunpowder juice in glass / drink crantini / pour cranberry juice in glass".
