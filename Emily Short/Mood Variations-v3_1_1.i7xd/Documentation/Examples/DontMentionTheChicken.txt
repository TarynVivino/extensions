Example: * Don't Mention The Chicken
Description: A character who has moody reactions to certain conversation triggers, and displays her mood changes in her speech and behavior.

	{*}"Don't Mention The Chicken"
	
	Include Mood Variations by Emily Short.
	
	The current interlocutor is an object that varies. The current interlocutor is Pam.

	The moods are friendly, neutral, and hostile.  The current mood of a person is usually neutral.
	
	The House is a room. Pam is a woman in the House.  The current mood of Pam is friendly.

	Instead of asking Pam about "love":
		say "'It's all right for some,' says Pam[when friendly], winking[or hostile], with a bit of a snarl in her voice. Clearly you've gotten on her bad side[at other times] blandly[end when]."

	Instead of asking Pam about "chicken":
		say "Pam sighs heavily[set hostile]. 'I hate poultry!'".
	
	Carry out waiting:
		set neutral.
	
	Every turn (this is the show mood-shifts rule):
		if the current mood of Pam is not the previous mood of Pam:
			repeat through the Table of Mood Changes:
				if the last entry is the previous mood of Pam and the new entry is the current mood of Pam:
					say "[description entry][paragraph break]";
					break.

	last	new	description
	neutral	hostile	"Pam is looking a lot less friendly now."
	neutral	friendly	"Pam seems to have relaxed a bit and is warming towards you."
	hostile	friendly	"You've completely turned around Pam's attitude."
	friendly	hostile	"Whoa, you clearly said the wrong thing there!"
	hostile	neutral	"Pam doesn't look really friendly, but she's no longer red with anger."
	friendly	neutral	"Pam crosses her arms, looking more guarded."

	Test me with "ask pam about love / wait / ask pam about love / ask pam about chicken / ask pam about love / wait / ask pam about love".
