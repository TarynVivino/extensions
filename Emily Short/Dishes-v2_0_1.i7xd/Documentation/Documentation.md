Dishes is a convenience extension for use with Measured Liquid by Emily Short. Dishes provides some standard-sized cups, glasses, graduated measuring cups, jugs, bottles, etc., as well as a corked bottle kind that opens with the use of a secondary cork object.

The kinds defined by dishes are:

	Glass: standard 12 oz (or similar in Metric units)
	Measuring Cup (graduated -- see Measured Liquid): 12.0 fl oz
	Cup: 8.0 fl oz / 237 mL
	Flask (openable, opaque): 10.0 fl oz. / 300 mL
	Bottle (openable, transparent): 25.0 fl oz / 750 mL
	Jug: 32.0 fl oz / 1000 mL

Glasses and cups are marked "preferred for drinking", which means that the game will try to have the player sip from these in preference to jugs or bottles, if a command is ambiguous.

A subkind of the bottle is the corked bottle: it has the same fluid capacity as an ordinary bottle, but it comes with a cork which must be removed for drinking.

A corkscrew kind is also provided. If there is a corkscrew in the game, it will be required to open a corked bottle for the first time; if not, the player character is presumed to have the gift of opening corked bottles by the power of his mind alone.
