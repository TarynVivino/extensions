Example: * Amtrak
Description: An Amtrak train running a long northeastern route, showing off absolutely-scheduled train-cars.

For the sake of example, I have given the train an impossibly fast schedule, so that we can see it arriving and departing on time without waiting through too many turns.

	{*}"Amtrak"

	Include Transit System by Emily Short.

	Chicago is west of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is west of Philadelphia. Philadelphia is south of New York. New York is southwest of Boston.

	The player is in New York.

	The Amtrak is an absolutely-scheduled train-car in Boston. The waiting duration of the Amtrak is 1 minute. The t-schedule of the Amtrak is the Table of Train Schedule.
