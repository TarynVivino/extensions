Example: * Reincarnation
Description: We have a vial of poison that the player recognizes only on the second playthrough.

	{*}"Reincarnation"
	
	Include Recorded Endings by Emily Short.

	The File of Conclusions is called "examplecon".

	The Cloudy Chamber is a room. It contains a wooden table. On the wooden table is a vial.

	The description of the vial is "It is full of a delicious-looking golden liquid."

	Instead of smelling the vial:
		say "It smells like honey wine."

	Rule for printing the name of the vial when "Death by poison" is a used ending:
		say "vial of poison".
		
	Understand "poison" or "of poison" as the vial when "Death by poison" is a used ending.

	Instead of drinking the vial:
		if "Death by poison" is a used ending:
			say "A chill comes over you as you consider it, as though you were being warned by a previous incarnation from another lifetime: this is foul poison.";
		otherwise:
			say "You lift the vial to your lips and throw it back. The flavor is sweet on your tongue, but the effects are nearly instant...";
			record "Death by poison" as an ending;
			end the story saying "You have died by poison".
