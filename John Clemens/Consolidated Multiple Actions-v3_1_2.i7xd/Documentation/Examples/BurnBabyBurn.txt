Example: *** Burn, Baby, Burn
Description: Adding a new action which allows multiple nouns.

We can add a new action which allows multiple nouns (or extend an already existing action) using the "[things]" token. In addition to the usual check, carry out, and report rules, we also need to add a rule for reporting consolidated actions for the new action (and a rule for reporting actions by others, if NPCs can be commanded to perform the action). Here we add a "burning it with" action.

Note that we would not want to use the strict action consolidation checking option here because of a possible "(first taking the lighter)" message.

Since the action only fails in one way, we can also add a new consolidated multiple actions rule to consolidate the failed action reports as well.

And just for fun, we vary the printing of the consolidated objects list a bit.

	{*}"Burn, Baby, Burn"
	
	Include Consolidated Multiple Actions by John Clemens.
	
	The Abandoned Warehouse is a room.
	
	The player carries a lighter.
	
	A thing can be flammable. A thing is usually not flammable.
	
	A book, a newspaper, and a bra are flammable things in the warehouse.
	A safe, a bottle of water, and a fire-resistant flag are here.
	
	Understand the command "burn" as something new.
	
	Understand "burn [things] with [something]" or "burn [things]" as burning it with. Burning it with is an action applying to one thing and one carried thing.
	Rule for supplying a missing second noun while burning with: now the second noun is the lighter.
	Check burning it with: if the second noun is not the lighter, instead say "[The second noun] is not a suitable fire-starter."
	Check burning it with: if the noun is not flammable, instead say "[The noun] refuses to catch fire."
	Carry out burning it with: remove the noun from play.
	Report burning it with: say "[The noun] bursts into flames and is soon gone."
	
	Rule for reporting consolidated actions when burning with: say "[The capitalized grouped consolidated objects list] burst[if the number of entries in the consolidated objects list is 1]s[end if] into flames and [if the number of entries in the consolidated objects list is 1]is[otherwise]are[end if] soon gone."
		
	A consolidated multiple actions rule for burning with (this is the consolidate inflammables rule):
		let L be the multiple object list;
		if the number of entries of L is at least 1:
			say "[The capitalized grouped L] refuse[if the number of entries in L is 1]s[end if] to catch fire.";
			truncate L to 0 entries;
			alter the multiple object list to L.
	
	The consolidate inflammables rule is listed after the consolidate multiple actions rule in the consolidated multiple actions rulebook.
	
	Rule for printing consolidated objects when not burning with:
		if the number of entries of the consolidated objects list is at least 3, say "a bunch of things[if the lighter is listed in the consolidated objects list], including [the lighter]";
		otherwise say the grouped consolidated objects list.
	
	Test me with "take all / i / drop all / burn everything!".
