	The perfume bottle is in the living room. The description is "A perfume spray bottle."

	Dispersing something is an activity.
	Rule for dispersing a room (called place):

	Understand "spray [something]" as spraying. Spraying is an action applying to one carried thing.
	Check spraying: if the noun is not the perfume, instead say "You can't spray that."
