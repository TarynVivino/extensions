	{*}"In the Army"

	Include Reversed Persuasion Correction by Juhana Leinonen.

	The Training camp is a room. Private Johnson, Private Smith, Private Stevens and Private Miller are men in the training camp.

	Persuasion rule for asking people to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.

	Instead of an actor jumping:
		say "[The person asked] jumps.";
		rule succeeds.

	Test me with "johnson, jump/jump, johnson/private, jump/stevens/jump, private/miller".
