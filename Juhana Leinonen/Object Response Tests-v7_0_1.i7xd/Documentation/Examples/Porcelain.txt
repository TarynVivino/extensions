Example: ** Porcelain
Description: Skipping tests that have destructive side effects

Ignoring a verb in certain cases involves removing the existing rules and writing new ones that take special cases into account.

	{*}"Porcelain"

	Include Object Response Tests by Juhana Leinonen.

	The Porcelain shop is a room.

	The Ming dynasty vase is in the porcelain shop. The description is "It looks very delicate and fragile."

	Instead of taking the Ming dynasty vase:
		say "You're afraid that you might drop it."

	After pushing or touching the Ming dynasty vase:
		say "Whoops! The vase falls off its pedestal and shatters into thousand pieces.";
		remove the Ming dynasty vase from play.

	Chapter Tests - Not for release

	When play begins:
		remove the test pushing rule;
		remove the test touching rule.

	This is the test pushing non-fragile things in rule:
		if the noun is not the Ming dynasty vase:
			announce tests for "pushing [the noun]";
			try pushing the noun.

	This is the test touching non-fragile things in rule:
		if the noun is not the Ming dynasty vase:
			announce tests for "touching [the noun]";
			try touching the noun.
