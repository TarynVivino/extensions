Example: * Camp Fire
Description: An example of basic use of the extension

	{*}"Camp Fire"

	Include Object Response Tests by Juhana Leinonen.

	The Camp is a room.

	The bonfire is in the Camp. It is fixed in place. The description is "The bonfire is blazing hot."

	Alice is a woman in the Camp.

	Instead of touching the bonfire:
		say "Ow! You almost burn your fingers."

	Test me with "analyze bonfire/try touching/analyze nounless/actor is Alice/analyze bonfire".

When we run the test, we notice that at least the response to "taste bonfire" should be changed to something more appropriate.
