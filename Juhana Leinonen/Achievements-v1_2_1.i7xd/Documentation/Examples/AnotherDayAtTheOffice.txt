Example: * Another Day at the Office
Description: Rule-based and manually awarded achievements

	{*}"Another Day at the Office"
	
	Include Achievements by Juhana Leinonen.

	Office is a room. "It's another boring afternoon in the office."

	The desk is in the office. The inbox is on the desk. The memo is in the inbox.

	A piece of gum is a thing.

	The time of day is 4:57 PM.

	Instead of looking under the desk for the first time:
		say "Hey, someone stuck a piece of gum under the desk!";
		now the player is carrying the piece of gum.
		
	After examining the memo:
		say "It's from the boss. You forget it as soon as you've read it.";
		award the "Diligent Employee" achievement.

	"Desk Treasure"	"You found the piece of gum."	gum achievement rule	false
	"Diligent Employee"	"You read the memo."	--	false
	"Overtime"	"Stayed at work past 5 pm."	overtime achievement rule

	This is the gum achievement rule:
		if the player is carrying the piece of gum:
			rule succeeds.
			
	This is the overtime achievement rule:
		if the time of day is greater than 5:00 PM:
			rule succeeds.

	Instead of exiting:
		say "Ok, that's enough for today.";
		end the story finally.
		
	Test me with "read memo/look under desk/z/z/exit".
