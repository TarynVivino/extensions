Example: ** Smarter TAKE ALL
Description: Excluding bulky items from TAKE ALL and informing the player about it.

	{*}"Smarter TAKE ALL"

	Include Bulky Items by Juhana Leinonen.

	Living room is a room. A television is in the living room. It is bulky. A remote control is in the living room.

	Rule for deciding whether all includes bulky things:
		it does not.

	Every turn when multiple taking:
		if a bulky handled thing is in the location and the current action is taking:
			say "(bulky items, i.e. [the list of bulky handled things in the location], were ignored)[line break]";

	Test me with "take all/take television/drop all/take all".
