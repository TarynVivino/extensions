	{*}"Bulky Containers"

	Include Bulky Items by Juhana Leinonen

	Living room is a room.

	The sack is a container. The player carries the sack.

	A television is in the living room. It is bulky.
	A coffee table is in the living room. It is bulky.
	A remote control is in the living room.
	A tv guide is in the living room.

	Check inserting something bulky into the sack when a bulky thing (called the previous occupant) is in the sack:
			say "There's no room for [the noun] anymore when [the previous occupant] [are] in the sack." instead.
	
	After inserting something bulky into the sack:
		now the sack is bulky;
		continue the action.
	
	After taking something:
		if the number of bulky things enclosed by the sack is 0:
			now the sack is not bulky;
		continue the action.
