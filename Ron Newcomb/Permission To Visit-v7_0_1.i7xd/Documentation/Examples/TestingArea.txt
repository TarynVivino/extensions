	{*}"Testing Area"

	Include Permission to Visit by Ron Newcomb. Use no scoring.
	
	Section 1 - as the story opens
	
	Area 51 is a region.
	Roswell is a region.
	HQ is a region.
	The RV is a region.
	
	Silo 1 and a shady spot are rooms.
	Silo 5 is a room in Area 51.
	The general store is a room in Roswell. "Everyone in Roswell stops by this filled-to-bursting little store.  It's amazing anyone can find anything."
	The office full of answers is a room in HQ. "Ah! Yes! It's all here! Aliens are involved!".
	your RV is a room in the RV. "Looking out the window of your RV, you can see the town of Roswell and, in the distance, a couple of grain silos. [if office is visited]'Oh bother, where's that keycard? I need it as proof!'[otherwise]'How odd, to have grain silos in the desert,' you ponder.[end if]". Understand "home" as your RV.
	
	Mayor 'Shorty' Grein Mannie is a man in shady spot.   The gatekeeper of Roswell is Mayor Mannie.
	The keycard is a thing in the store.  The gatekeeper of HQ is the keycard.
	The player is in your RV. The gatekeeper of the RV is yourself.
	
	[ Intentionally creating "spot" as an animal, a room, and a thing.]
	A dalmatian named Spot is an animal in silo 1.  Understand "dog" as the dalmatian.
	A targeting spot missile is a thing in silo 5. It is not portable.
	The printed name of shady spot is "shady spot behind silo 1".
	
	Shady spot is north of Silo 1. The general store is north of shady spot.
	
	Definition: a thing is inanimate if it is not a person.
	Definition: a region is player-owned rather than other-owned if the player is the gatekeeper of it.
	
	First carry out taking inventory:
		if the number of player-owned regions is not 0, say "You own [the list of player-owned regions].";
		otherwise say "You don't own any real estate.  Even your apartment is rented."
	
	When play begins: now the left hand status line is "[the location of the player], within [the map region of the location of the player]"; say "You arrive in Roswell NV just as your TV blares the news, 'Roswell is now under martial law, as declared by its brand-new ruler, Mayor 'Shorty' Grein Mannie.  Checkpoints are setup around the town's entry points, and no one without explicit permission is allowed in.'[line break][line break]You're sure it's just a suggestion, though.[line break][line break]You must get into the main offices of Area 51 to find out what's really going on.".
	
	The agenda is a thing in your RV. The description of it is "People to visit: [a list of people which is not the player].[line break]Things to find: [a list of every inanimate thing not carried by the player].[line break]Places to travel: [a list of every unvisited room].[line break]Regions to explore: [a list of every region]."
	
	
	Section 2 - a strange device
	
	The bizarre cattle prod is a thing in Silo 1. The description of the bizarre cattle prod is "There's a disclaimer sticker on it that reads, 'Warning: do not [bold type]touch[roman type] yourself with the mind-control prod.'".
	
	Understand "zap [someone]" as touching.
	Persuasion for asking the dalmatian to try doing something when we have touched the dalmatian: rule succeeds.
	Persuasion for asking the mayor to try doing something when we have touched the mayor: rule succeeds.
	
	Instead of touching:
		if the noun is the dalmatian, say "You pet Spot, but it doesn't win him over.";
		if the noun is the mayor, say "You shake hands with the mayor, but it doesn't win him over.";
	
	
	Section 3 - a likely ordering of events
	
	Instead of touching someone when the prod is carried, say "[The noun] goes kinda glassy-eyed[if the noun is the mayor] and says, 'Yes, my leader. You may [bold type]take[roman type] Roswell, or any other region you desire'[end if]."
	
	Understand "take [any region]" as taking ownership when the player carries the cattle prod. Taking ownership is an action applying to one visible thing. Check an actor taking ownership HQ: say "Hm. A keycard-locked door keeps you out, and the mind-control prod doesn't seem to be much help with inanimate objects." instead. Check an actor taking ownership: if the actor is the gatekeeper of the noun, say "[Actor] already owns that." instead. Carry out an actor taking ownership: now the gatekeeper of the noun is the actor; say "[Actor] now owns [the noun].".
	
	Carry out travelling to when the location is the office: say "In your haste to leave, you accidentally drop the keycard!"; try silently dropping keycard.
	
	Instead of travelling to the office when the keycard is in the office: say "Curses! It's in the office! You've locked yourself out! What an unwinnable state of affairs!"
	
	Instead of touching yourself when the prod is carried: end the story saying "You go kinda glassy-eyed until a unnerved cop, three days later, orders you to drop the weapon."
	
	Test all with "test spot/go home/test me".
	Test spot with "go home/visit spot/go home/go to spot/go home/find spot". [broken: FIND doesn't go to Target Spot Missile]
	Test me with "take agenda/x agenda/go office/go store/visit silo 1/x prod/take prod/touch the dog/n/touch the mayor/take roswell/i/x agenda/take area 51/go to office/take hq/find keycard/take keycard/go to office/i/find RV/find keycard/x agenda/touch me".
