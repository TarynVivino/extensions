Including this extension adds about sixty new verbs to a story's vocabulary, including words like GRAB, INSPECT, DESCEND, and KICK. Note that no new actions are created: these are all simply synonyms for existing commands.

A few new command forms are also understood as well: for instance, CLIMB UP is understood as going, CLIMB INTO THE CHAIR as entering, and CLIMB ON WALL as climbing, all three of which are normally unrecognized.

The functionality is similar to that provided by the old Inform 6 extension ExpertGrammar.h by Emily Short, minus some of the features since incorporated by default into Inform's grammar, and plus a few words and command forms I observed new IF players try to use during the testing of various projects. Emily's comments in the original extension note that many of these words are either standard in other IF languages, or were observed in the command logs of an online version of Zork.
