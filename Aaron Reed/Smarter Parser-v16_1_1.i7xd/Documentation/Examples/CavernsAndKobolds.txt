Description: A tiny scenario to test misunderstood input with.

	{*}"Caverns and Kobolds"

	Include Smarter Parser by Aaron Reed.

	Spooky Cave is a room. A glowing sword is in Spooky Cave. Dark Tunnel is north of Spooky Cave. A dusty skull is in Dark Tunnel. The kobold is a man in Tunnel. The kobold holds a spear.

	A smarter parser rule (this is the no leet speak allowed rule):
		if input contains "\w\d+\w":
			identify error as no leet speak allowed rule;
			reject the command.

	A smarter parser rule (this is the stripping formal address rule):
		if stripping "(sir|maam)" is fruitful:
			identify error as stripping formal address rule;
			reparse the command.
			
	A smarter parser rule (this is the signs of frustration rule):
		if input contains "(stupid|damn|idiot|hate)":
			identify error as signs of frustration rule;
			reject the command.

	The stripping formal address rule is listed first in the smarter parser rules.
