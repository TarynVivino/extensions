Example: ** Where ever thou art
Description: Demonstrating the use of achievements, locations scored and items scored.

	{*}"Where ever thou art"

	Include Version 4 of Achievements by Mikael Segercrantz.

Let's create the three rooms first.

	The entrance hall is a room. The basement is a room. The dining hall is a room.

Add a door and the connections:

	A wooden door is a door. It is west of the entrance hall and east of the dining hall. It is closed and openable.

	The basement is below the entrance hall.

Add some treasure:

	A baseball cap is a thing. Some crates are in the basement. They are fixed in place.

	Instead of searching the crates for the first time:
		now the baseball cap is in the basement;
		say "Tucked behind crates of various things, you find a baseball cap!"
	
	After opening the wooden door, score the achievement with message "finding the way to the dining hall".

And the tables:

	Table of Achievements (continued)
	used		points		message
	0		10		"finding the way to the dining hall"

	Table of Scored Places (continued)
	used		points		loci
	0		5		basement
	0		5		dining hall

	Table of Scored Objects (continued)
	used		points		object
	0		5		baseball cap

	Table of Achievement Rankings (continued)
	minimum	rank
	0		"beginner"
	10		"explorer"
	20		"leader"
	25		"master"

Initialize status line:

	When play begins:
		now the right hand status line is "[score] out of [achievement maximum score]".

Ending the game:

	Every turn:
		if the score is the achievement maximum score, end the story finally saying "You have won."

And finally the testing command:

	Test me with " open door / score / w / score / e / d / score / search crates / take cap ".
