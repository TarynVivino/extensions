	Include Clues and Conversation by Brian Rushton.

	Classroom is a room.

	Noether is a woman in Classroom. Hypatia is a woman in Classroom. Gauss is a man in Classroom. Euler is a man in Classroom.
	
	When play begins:
		deliver Roll Call;
		
	Roll Call is a quip. The preview of Roll Call is "You need to take roll.".

	TargetResponse of a Roll Call is "[if CurrentTarget is Noether]You say, 'Noether?'

	'Present!' she says.[otherwise if CurrentTarget is Hypatia]You say, 'Hypatia?'

	'I'm here!' she says.[otherwise if CurrentTarget is Gauss]You say, 'Gauss?'

	'Yup,' he says.[otherwise if CurrentTarget is Euler]You say, 'Euler?'

	'That's what they call me,' he says.[end if]"

	Test me with "recall roll call / say roll call to noether / recall roll call / say roll call to hypatia / recall roll call / say roll call to gauss / say roll call to euler / recall roll call / say roll call to noether / recall roll call"
