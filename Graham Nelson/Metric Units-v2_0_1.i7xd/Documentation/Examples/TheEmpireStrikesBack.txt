Example: ** The Empire Strikes Back
Description: Using good old Imperial measures of length and area alongside these Frenchified metric ones.

Imperial measures, often going back to obscure customs in Anglo-Saxon England, were inflicted across much of the world in the heyday of the British Empire.  Some are still very much alive in England and its former colonies (Australia, India, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, the USA and so on) - miles and feet, for instance. Others continue only in unscientific social customs, like sport: horse-races are measured in furlongs; the running distance between the two wickets of a cricket pitch is 22 yards, which is 1 chain exactly; and even in France, a football goal must be 8 feet high and 8 yards wide.

	1 inch (in imperial units, in inches, singular) or 2 inches (in imperial units, in inches, plural) specifies a length equivalent to 2.5cm.
	1 foot (in imperial units, in feet, singular) or 2 feet (in imperial units, in feet, plural) specifies a length equivalent to 12 inches.
	1 yard (in imperial units, in yards, singular) or 2 yards (in imperial units, in yards, plural) specifies a length equivalent to 3 feet.
	1 chain (in imperial units, in chains, singular) or 2 chains (in imperial units, in chains, plural) specifies a length equivalent to 22 yards.
	1 furlong (in imperial units, in furlongs, singular) or 2 furlongs (in imperial units, in furlongs, plural) specifies a length equivalent to 10 chains.
	1 mile (in imperial units, in miles, singular) or 2 miles (in imperial units, in miles, plural) specifies a length equivalent to 8 furlongs.
	1 league (in imperial units, in leagues, singular) or 2 leagues (in imperial units, in leagues, plural) specifies a length equivalent to 3 miles.
	
	1 square foot (in imperial units, in square feet, singular) or 2 square feet (in imperial units, in square feet, plural) specifies an area equivalent to 900 sq cm.
	1 square yard (in imperial units, in square yards, singular) or 2 square yards (in imperial units, in square yards, plural) specifies an area equivalent to 9 square feet.
	1 acre (in imperial units, in acres, singular) or 2 acres (in imperial units, in acres, plural) specifies an area equivalent to 4840 square yards.
	
	Understand "convert [a length]" as converting. Converting is an action applying to one length.
	
	Carry out converting:
		let A be the length understood;
		say "Measuring A = [A], which ";
		say "= [A in millimetres] ";
		say "= [A in centimetres] ";
		say "= [A in metres] ";
		say "= [A in kilometres] ";
		say "= [A in inches] ";
		say "= [A in feet] ";
		say "= [A in yards] ";
		say "= [A in chains] ";
		say "= [A in furlongs] ";
		say "= [A in miles] ";
		say "= [A in leagues].";
		say "Metric: [A in metric units].";
		say "Imperial: [A in Imperial units].[paragraph break]";
		
	Test me with "convert 1.2m / convert 2m / convert 30cm / convert 20 chains".

The above conversions are based on 1 inch equals 2.5cm, which is not very accurate: 2.54cm would be closer. But to get that accuracy we would need to represent lengths down to 0.4mm, which is below the 1mm cutoff imposed by 'Metric Units'. We'll accept this 2% error in lengths (or 4% error in areas) as harmless, given that we're not going to be doing any serious calculations in Imperial units; if we were, we'd do better to make a fresh extension for them.

Confusions still cause spectacular failures, as when an Air Canada ground crew mixed up pounds and kilograms and fuelled a Boeing 767 so lightly in 1983 that it ran dry at 41,000 feet, losing all engines, avionics and electricity. The captain, by great good luck also an amateur glider pilot, made a now-legendary landing at an obscure airstrip which the first officer by great good luck had once flown from. The USA's Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft, whose navigation software confused pounds and newtons, was not so lucky and burned up in the Martian atmosphere in 1998 at a cost of $330 million.
