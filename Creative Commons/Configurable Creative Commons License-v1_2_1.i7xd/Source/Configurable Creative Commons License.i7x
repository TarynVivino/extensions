Section 0 - Implement various Creative Commons license types

CC license type is a kind of value. The CC license types are undefined, by-nc-nd, by-nc-sa, by-nc, by-nd, by-sa, and by.

A CC license type has a text called CC license name.

The CC license name of undefined is "<Undefined>".
The CC license name of by-nc-nd is "Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs [CC license variant]".
The CC license name of by-nc-sa is "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike [CC license variant]".
The CC license name of by-nc is "Attribution-NonCommercial [CC license variant]".
The CC license name of by-nd is "Attribution-NoDerivs [CC license variant]".
The CC license name of by-sa is "Attribution-ShareAlike [CC license variant]".
The CC license name of by is "Attribution [CC license variant]".

A CC license type has a text called expanded CC license name.

The expanded CC license name of undefined is "<Undefined>".
The expanded CC license name of by-nc-nd is "Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works [CC license variant]".
The expanded CC license name of by-nc-sa is "Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike [CC license variant]".
The expanded CC license name of by-nc is "Attribution-Noncommercial [CC license variant]".
The expanded CC license name of by-nd is "Attribution-No Derivative Works [CC license variant]".
The expanded CC license name of by-sa is "Attribution-Share Alike [CC license variant]".
The expanded CC license name of by is "Attribution [CC license variant]".

CC license variant is a text that varies. CC license variant is "3.0 Unported".

To decide whether (variant - a CC license type) specifies NoDerivs:
	if variant is by-nc-nd, decide yes;
	if variant is by-nd, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a CC license type is ND if it specifies NoDerivs.

To decide whether (variant - a CC license type) specifies NonCommercial:
	if variant is by-nc-nd, decide yes;
	if variant is by-nc-sa, decide yes;
	if variant is by-nc, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a CC license type is NC if it specifies NonCommercial.

To decide whether (variant - a CC license type) specifies ShareAlike:
	if variant is by-nc-sa, decide yes;
	if variant is by-sa, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a CC license type is SA if it specifies ShareAlike.

To decide whether (variant - a CC license type) specifies Attribution:
	decide yes.

[Definition: a CC license type is BY if it specifies Attribution.] [Compiler didn't like this -- interferes with license types enumeration.]

Default CC license type is a CC license type that varies. Default CC license type is by-nc-sa.

CC license chosen is a CC license type that varies.

When play begins while CC license chosen is undefined (this is the apply default license if no type specified by author rule):
	now CC license chosen is the default CC license type.
